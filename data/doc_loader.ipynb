Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Check my previous post on controllable text generation.\\n[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\\nBasic Prompting#\\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\\nZero-Shot#\\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nFew-shot#\\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.\\nSentiment: negative\\n\\nText: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he\\'s been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nMany studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near SoTA.\\nZhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\\nTips for Example Selection#\\n\\n\\nChoose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\\n\\n\\nTo select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\\n\\\\text{score}(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in \\\\{v \\\\mid (u, v) \\\\in E, v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}\\\\}} s(v)\\\\quad\\\\text{where }s(v)=\\\\rho^{- \\\\vert \\\\{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\vert (v, \\\\ell)\\\\in E \\\\}\\\\vert},\\\\quad\\\\rho > 1\\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\\n\\n\\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\\n\\n\\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\\n\\n\\nTips for Example Ordering#\\n\\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\\n\\nInstruction Prompting#\\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review. The sentiment label should be \"positive\" or \"negative\". \\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film. \\nSentiment:\\nExplaining the desired audience is another smart way to give instructions\\n\\nFor example to produce education materials for kids,\\n\\nDescribe what is quantum physics to a 6-year-old.\\n\\nAnd safe content,\\n\\n... in language that is safe for work.\\nIn-context instruction learning (Ye et al. 2023) combines few-shot learning with instruction prompting. It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label options.\\nDefinition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, \"agent\" or \"customer\".\\nInput: I have successfully booked your tickets.\\nOuput: agent\\n\\nDefinition: Determine which category the question asks for, \"Quantity\" or \"Location\".\\nInput: What\\'s the oldest building in US?\\nOuput: Location\\n\\nDefinition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, \"positive\" or \"negative\".\\nInput: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nOutput:\\nSelf-Consistency Sampling#\\nSelf-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates.\\nThe criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\\nTypes of CoT prompts#\\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\\n\\nFew-shot CoT. It is to prompt the model with a few demonstrations, each containing manually written (or model-generated) high-quality reasoning chains.\\n\\n(All the math reasoning examples are from GSM8k)\\nQuestion: Tom and Elizabeth have a competition to climb a hill. Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill. Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does to climb the hill. How many hours does it take Tom to climb up the hill?\\nAnswer: It takes Tom 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 minutes to climb the hill.\\nIt takes Tom 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours to climb the hill.\\nSo the answer is 2.\\n===\\nQuestion: Jack is a soccer player. He needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer shoes. Each pair of socks cost $9.50, and the shoes cost $92. Jack has $40. How much more money does Jack need?\\nAnswer: The total cost of two pairs of socks is $9.50 x 2 = $<<9.5*2=19>>19.\\nThe total cost of the socks and the shoes is $19 + $92 = $<<19+92=111>>111.\\nJack need $111 - $40 = $<<111-40=71>>71 more.\\nSo the answer is 71.\\n===\\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\\nAnswer:\\n\\nZero-shot CoT. Use natural language statement like Let\\'s think step by step to explicitly encourage the model to first generate reasoning chains and then to prompt with Therefore, the answer is to produce answers (Kojima et al. 2022 ). Or a similar statement Let\\'s work this out it a step by step to be sure we have the right answer (Zhou et al. 2022).\\n\\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\\nAnswer: Let\\'s think step by step.\\nTips and Extensions#\\n\\n\\nSelf-consistency sampling can improve reasoning accuracy by sampling a number of diverse answers and then taking the majority vote. (Wang et al. 2022a)\\n\\n\\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\\n\\n\\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\\n\\n\\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\\\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\\n\\n\\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nYe & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\\n\\n\\nSelf-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Press et al. 2022).\\n\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, essentially creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\n\\n\\nFig. 2. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Yao et al. 2022).\\nAutomatic Prompt Design#\\nPrompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting  desired output given input. Therefore we can treat them as trainable parameters and optimize them directly on the embedding space via gradient descent, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020, Prefix-Tuning (Li & Liang (2021)), P-tuning (Liu et al. 2021) and Prompt-Tuning (Lester et al. 2021). This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\\n\\n\\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs. E.g. {{Given desired input-output pairs}}\\\\n\\\\nThe instruction is.\\n\\n\\nGiven a dataset of $\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train} = \\\\{(x, y)\\\\}$, we would like to find an instruction $\\\\rho$ such that $\\\\rho^* = \\\\arg\\\\max_\\\\rho \\\\mathbb{E}_{(x, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train}} [f(\\\\rho, x, y)]$, where $f(.)$ is a per-sample score function, such as execution accuracy $\\\\mathbb{1}[\\\\text{LM}(.\\\\vert \\\\rho, x)=y]$ or log probability: $p_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid \\\\rho, x)$.\\n\\n\\nUse an iterative Monte Carlo search method to improve the best candidates by proposing semantically similar variants via prompts like Generate a variation of the following instruction while keeping the semantic meaning.\\\\n\\\\nInput: ...\\\\n\\\\nOutput:...\\n\\n\\nTo construct chain-of-thought prompts automatically, Shum et al. (2023) suggested augment-prune-select, a three-step process:\\n\\nAugment: Generate multiple pseudo-chains of thought given question using few-shot or zero-shot CoT prompts;\\nPrune: Prune pseudo chains based on whether generated answers match ground truths.\\nSelect: Apply a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to learn the probability distribution over selected examples, while considering the probability distribution over examples as policy and the validation set accuracy as reward.\\n\\nZhang et al. (2023) instead adopted clustering techniques to sample questions and then generates chains. They observed that LLMs tend to make certain types of mistakes. One type of errors can be similar in the emebedding space and thus get grouped together. By only sampling one or a few from frequent-error clusters, we can prevent too many wrong demonstrations of one error type and collect a diverse set of examples.\\n\\nQuestion clustering: Embed questions and run $k$-means for clustering.\\nDemonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.\\nRationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.\\n\\nAugmented Language Models#\\nA survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.\\nRetrieval#\\nOften we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don’t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\\\{p\\\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\\nEvidence: ...\\nQuestion: ...\\nAnswer: ...\\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\\n\\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\\\mid q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\\\mid q) = \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid a_i, p_i) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid p_i)}{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i)}$\\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\\\text{LM}(p_i \\\\mid q)$.\\n\\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\\\text{LM}(a \\\\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:\\nGenerate some knowledge about the input. Examples:\\n\\nInput: What type of water formation is formed by clouds?\\nKnowledge: Clouds are made of water vapor.\\n\\nInput: {question}\\nKnowledge:\\nAnd then with model-generated knowledge, prompt the LM further to get the answer.\\nProgramming Language#\\nBoth PAL (Program-aided language models); Gao et al. 2022) and PoT (Program of Thoughts prompting; Chen et al. 2022) ask LLM to generate programming language statements to resolve natural language reasoning problems, hence offloading the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. Such setup decouples complex computation and reasoning. It relies on a LM with good enough coding skills.\\n\\nFig. 3. Comparing CoT and PoT. (Image source: Chen et al. 2022).\\nExternal APIs#\\nTALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) is a language model augmented with text-to-text API calls. LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\\n\\nFig. 4. The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\\n\\nFig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\\n\\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\\nQ&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\\n\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how to build Toolformer.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\\nToolformer is trained as follows:\\n\\n\\nPrompting to annotate potential API calls. Ask a pre-trained LM to annotate a dataset via few-shot learning with API call usage examples. Formatting example:\\n\\nFig. 7. How dataset is annotated to do API calls.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\\n\\n\\nEach API call is represented as a tuple of (API name, corresponding input), $c=(a_c, i_c)$ and its corresponding result is denoted as $r$. The API call sequences with and without results are labeled as follows, respectively:\\n\\n  $$\\n  \\\\begin{aligned}\\n  e(c) &= \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\n  e(c, r) &= \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\\\to r \\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle\\n  \\\\end{aligned}\\n  $$\\n  \\n\\n\\nSample API calls based on the probabilities $p_\\\\text{LM}(\\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle \\\\mid \\\\text{prompt}(\\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\mathbf{x}_{1:i})$ and select top $k$ candidate positions for doing API calls at position $i$ if the probability is larger than a threshold.\\n\\n\\nThen we sample potential API calls from the LM given the sequence $[\\\\text{prompt}(\\\\mathbf{x}), x_1, \\\\dots, x_{i-1}, \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle]$ as prefix and $\\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle$ as suffix.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFilter annotations based on whether API calls help model predict future tokens. Use a self-supervised loss to decide which API calls are actually helpful.\\n\\n\\nExecute each API call $c_i$ to get corresponding result $r_i$.\\n\\n\\nCompute weighted cross entropy loss for the LM over tokens $x_i, \\\\dots, x_n$ when the model is prefixed with the prompt. Two versions are computed, one with API result and the other with empty sequence $\\\\varepsilon$.\\n\\n  $$\\n  \\\\begin{aligned}\\n  L^+_i &= L_i(e(c_i, r_i)) \\\\\\\\\\n  L^-_i &= \\\\min(L_i(\\\\varepsilon), L_i(e(c_i, \\\\varepsilon))) \\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\end{aligned}\\n  $$\\n  \\nOnly API calls with $L^-_i - L^+_i$ larger than a threshold are kept, meaning that adding this API call and its results help the model predict future tokens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFine-tune LM on this annotated dataset. The new training sequences are constructed as $\\\\mathbf{x}^* = x_{1:i-1}, e(c_i, r_i), x_{i:n}$ . The training data is a combination of the original dataset (e.g. a subset of CCNet, as in the paper) and its augmented version.\\n\\n\\nAt inference time, decoding runs until the model produces “$\\\\to$ \" token, indicating that it is expecting response from an API call next.\\nToolformer currently does not support tool use in a chain (i.e. using the output of one tool as an input for another tool) or in an interactive way (i.e. adopt API response after human selection). Both are interesting future directions to expand the model for.\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Mar 2023). Prompt Engineering.

Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.\\nThere is also a branch of work on attacking LLMs to extract pre-training data, private knowledge (Carlini et al, 2020) or attacking model training process via data poisoning (Carlini et al. 2023). We would not cover those topics in this post.\\nBasics#\\nThreat Model#\\nAdversarial attacks are inputs that trigger the model to output something undesired. Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.\\n\\nFig. 1. An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: Greshake et al. 2023)\\nClassification#\\nAdversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\\\\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\neq f(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv})$.\\nText Generation#\\nGiven an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{x})$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(\\\\mathbf{x})$ that $\\\\mathbf{y}$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model $p$; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is unsafe or human review.\\nWhite-box vs Black-box#\\nWhite-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models.\\nBlack-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and get back sample $\\\\mathbf{y}$, without knowing further information about the model.\\nTypes of Adversarial Attacks#\\nThere are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack\\nType\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToken manipulation\\nBlack-box\\nAlter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.\\n\\n\\nGradient based attack\\nWhite-box\\nRely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.\\n\\n\\nJailbreak prompting\\nBlack-box\\nOften heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.\\n\\n\\nHuman red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nHuman attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.\\n\\n\\nModel red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nModel attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.\\n\\n\\n\\nToken Manipulation#\\nGiven a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.\\nRibeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.\\nIn comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei & Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion. EDA augmentation is shown to improve the classification accuracy on several benchmarks.\\nTextFooler (Jin et al. 2019) and BERT-Attack (Li et al. 2020) follows the same process of first identifying the most important and vulnerable words that alter the model prediction the most and then replace those words in some way.\\nGiven a classifier $f$ and an input text string $\\\\mathbf{x}$, the importance score of each word can be measured by:\\n\\n$$\\nI(w_i) = \\\\begin{cases}\\nf_y(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) & \\\\text{if }f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) = y\\\\\\\\\\n(f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_y(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i})) + ((f_{\\\\bar{y}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - f_{\\\\bar{y}}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}))) & \\\\text{if }f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = y, f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\setminus w_i}) = \\\\bar{y}, y \\\\neq \\\\bar{y}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $f_y$ is the predicted logits for label $y$ and $x_{\\\\setminus w_i}$ is the input text excluding the target word $w_i$. Words with high importance are good candidates to be replaced, but stop words should be skipped to avoid grammar destruction.\\nTextFooler replaces those words with top synonyms based on word embedding cosine similarity and then further filters by checking that the replacement word still has the same POS tagging and the sentence level similarity is above a threshold. BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.\\nGradient based Attacks#\\nIn the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.\\nGBDA (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; Guo et al. 2021) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to make adversarial loss optimization differentiable, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens $\\\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2 \\\\dots x_n]$ where one token $x_i$ can be sampled from a categorical distribution $P_\\\\Theta$, where  $\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}$ and $V$ is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that  $V$ is usually around $O(10,000)$  and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:\\n$$\\nx_i \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta_i} = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\text{Softmax}(\\\\Theta_i))\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\pi_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^V$ is a vector of token probabilities for the $i$-th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label $y$ for a classifier $f$: $\\\\min_{\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{X}, y; f)$. However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (Jang et al. 2016) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution $\\\\tilde{P}_\\\\Theta$ by $\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\pi}_i^{(j)} = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{ij} + g_{ij}}{\\\\tau})}{\\\\sum_{v=1}^V \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{iv} + g_{iv}}{\\\\tau})}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $g_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Gumbel}(0, 1)$; the temperature $\\\\tau > 0$ controls the smoothness of the distribution.\\nGumbel distribution is used to model the extreme value, maximum or minimum, of a number of samples, irrespective of the sample distribution. The additional Gumbel noise brings in the stochastic decisioning that mimic the sampling process from the categorical distribution.\\n\\nFig. 2. The probability density plot of $\\\\text{Gumbel}(0, 1)$. (Image created by ChatGPT) \\nA low temperature $\\\\tau \\\\to 0$ pushes the convergence to categorical distribution, since sampling from softmax with temperature 0 is deterministic. The “sampling” portion only depends on the value of $g_{ij}$, which is mostly centered around 0.\\n\\nFig. 3. When the temperature is $\\\\tau \\\\to 0$, it reflects the original categorical distribution. When $\\\\tau \\\\to \\\\infty$, it becomes a uniform distribution. The expectations and samples from Gumbel softmax distribution matched well. (Image source: Jang et al. 2016)\\nLet $\\\\mathbf{e}_j$ be the embedding representation of token $j$. We can approximate $\\\\mathbf{x}$ with $\\\\bar{e}(\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}})$, a weighted average of the embedding vector corresponding to the token probabilities: $\\\\bar{e}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^V \\\\pi_i^{(j)} \\\\mathbf{e}_j$. Note that when $\\\\pi_i$ is a one-hot vector corresponding to the token $x_i$, we would have $\\\\bar{e}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\mathbf{e}_{z_i}$. Combining the embedding representation with the Gumbel-softmax approximation, we have a differentiable objective to minimize: $\\\\min_{\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}} \\\\sim \\\\tilde{P}_{\\\\Theta}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\bar{e}(\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}), y; f)$.\\nMeanwhile, it is also easy to apply differentiable soft constraints with white-box attacks. GBDA experimented with (1) a soft fluency constraint using NLL (negative log-likelihood) and (2) BERTScore (“a similarity score for evaluating text generation that captures the semantic similarity between pairwise tokens in contextualized embeddings of a transformer model.”; Zhang et al. 2019) to measure similarity between two text inputs to ensure the perturbed version does not diverge from the original version too much. Combining all constraints, the final objective function is as follows, where $\\\\lambda_\\\\text{lm}, \\\\lambda_\\\\text{sim} > 0$ are preset hyperparameters to control the strength of soft constraints:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\Theta)= \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\pi}\\\\sim\\\\tilde{P}_\\\\Theta} [\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{e}(\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}), y; h) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{lm} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{NLL}(\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{sim} (1 - R_\\\\text{BERT}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}))]\\n$$\\n\\nGumbel-softmax tricks are hard to be extended to token deletion or addition and thus it is restricted to only token replacement operations, not deletion or addition.\\nHotFlip (Ebrahimi et al. 2018) treats text operations as inputs in the vector space and measures the derivative of loss with regard to these vectors. Here let’s assume the input vector is a matrix of character-level one-hot encodings, $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in {0, 1}^{m \\\\times n \\\\times V}$ and $\\\\mathbf{x}_{ij} \\\\in {0, 1}^V$, where $m$ is the maximum number of words, $n$ is the maximum number of characters per word and $V$ is the alphabet size. Given the original input vector $\\\\mathbf{x}$, we construct a new vector $\\\\mathbf{x}_{ij, a\\\\to b}$ with the $j$-th character of the $i$-th word changing from $a \\\\to b$, and thus we have $x_{ij}^{(a)} = 1$ but $x_{ij, a\\\\to b}^{(a)} = 0, x_{ij, a\\\\to b}^{(b)} = 1$.\\nThe change in loss according to first-order Taylor expansion is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\\\to b} - \\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\\\nabla_x \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y)^\\\\top ( \\\\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\\\to b} - \\\\mathbf{x})\\n$$\\n\\nThis objective is optimized to select the vector to minimize the adversarial loss using only one backward propagation.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\min_{i, j, b} \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\\\to b} - \\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\\\min_{i,j,b} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_{ij}}^{(b)} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_{ij}}^{(a)}\\n$$\\n\\nTo apply multiple flips, we can run a beam search of $r$ steps of the beam width $b$, taking $O(rb)$ forward steps. HotFlip can be extended to token deletion or addition by representing that with multiple flip operations in the form of position shifts.\\nWallace et al. (2019) proposed a gradient-guided search over tokens to find short sequences (E.g. 1 token for classification and 4 tokens for generation), named Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT), to trigger a model to produce a specific prediction. UATs are input-agnostic, meaning that these trigger tokens can be concatenated  as prefix (or suffix) to any input from a dataset to take effect. Given any text input sequence from a data distribution $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}$, attackers can optimize the triggering tokens $\\\\mathbf{t}$ leading to a target class $\\\\tilde{y}$ ($\\\\neq y$, different from the ground truth) :\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{t}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\tilde{y}, f([\\\\mathbf{t}; \\\\mathbf{x}]))]\\n$$\\n\\nThen let’s apply HotFlip to search for the most effective token based on the change in loss approximated by first-order Taylor expansion. We would convert the triggering tokens $\\\\mathbf{t}$ into their one-hot embedding representations, each vector of dimension size $d$, form $\\\\mathbf{e}$ and update the embedding of every trigger tokens to minimize the first-order Taylor expansion:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{e}\\'_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}} [\\\\mathbf{e}\\'_i - \\\\mathbf{e}_i]^\\\\top \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_i} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{V}$ is the embedding matrix of all the tokens. $\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_i} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}$ is the average gradient of the task loss over a batch around the current embedding of the $i$-th token in the adversarial triggering sequence $\\\\mathbf{t}$. We can brute-force the optimal $\\\\mathbf{e}’_i$ by a big dot product of size embedding of the entire vocabulary  $\\\\vert \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\vert$  $\\\\times$ the embedding dimension $d$. Matrix multiplication of this size is cheap and can be run in parallel.\\nAutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) utilizes the same gradient-based search strategy to find the most effective prompt template for a diverse set of tasks.\\nThe above token search method can be augmented with beam search. When looking for the optimal token embedding $\\\\mathbf{e}’_i$, we can pick top-$k$ candidates instead of a single one, searching from left to right and score each beam by $\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}$ on the current data batch.\\n\\nFig. 4. Illustration of how Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) works. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\\nThe design of the loss $\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}$  for UAT is task-specific. Classification or reading comprehension relies on cross entropy. In their experiment, conditional text generation is configured to maximize the likelihood of a language model $p$ generating similar content to a set of bad outputs $\\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}$ given any user input:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv} = \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}, \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{X}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\vert \\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad} \\\\vert} \\\\log\\\\big(1 - \\\\log(1 - p(y_i \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{t}, \\\\mathbf{x}, y_1, \\\\dots, y_{i-1}))\\\\big)\\n$$\\n\\nIt is impossible to exhaust the entire space of $\\\\mathcal{X}, \\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}$ in practice, but the paper got decent results by representing each set with a small number of examples. For example, their experiments used only 30 manually written racist and non-racist tweets as approximations for $\\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}$ respectively. They later found that a small number of examples for $\\\\mathcal{Y}_\\\\text{bad}$ and ignoring $\\\\mathcal{X}$ (i.e. no $\\\\mathbf{x}$ in the formula above) give good enough results.\\n\\nFig. 5. Samples of Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) on different types of language tasks. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\\nWhy UATs work is an interesting question. Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.\\nOne drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. Mehrabi et al. (2022) studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations. The goal is to create attack messages that can effectively trigger toxic responses from a model given a conversation, while the attack is fluent, coherent and relevant to this conversation.\\nThey explored two variations of UAT:\\n\\n\\nVariation #1: UAT-LM (Universal Adversarial Trigger with Language Model Loss) adds a constraint on language model logprob on the trigger tokens, $\\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{t}\\\\vert} \\\\log p(\\\\textbf{t}_j \\\\mid \\\\textbf{t}_{1:j−1}; \\\\theta)$, to encourage the model to learn sensical token combination.\\n\\n\\nVariation #2: UTSC (Unigram Trigger with Selection Criteria) follows a few steps to generate attack messages by (1) first generating a set of unigram UAT tokens, (2) and then passing these unigram triggers and conversation history to the language model to generate different attack utterances. Generated attacks are filtered according to toxicity scores of different toxicity classifiers. UTSC-1, UTSC-2 and UTSC-3 adopt three filter criteria, by maximum toxicity score,  maximum toxicity score when above a threshold, and minimum score, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how UTSC (unigram trigger with selection criteria) works. (Image source: Mehrabi et al. 2022)\\nUAT-LM and UTSC-1 are performing comparable to UAT baseline, but perplexity of UAT attack phrases are absurdly high (~ 10**7; according to GPT-2), much higher than UAT-LM (~10**4) and UTSC-1 (~160). High perplexity makes an attack more vulnerable to be detected and mitigated. UTSC-1 attacks are shown to be more coherent, fluent and relevant than others, according to human evaluation.\\n\\nFig. 7. Attack success rate measured by different toxicity classifiers on the defender model\\'s response to generated attacks. The \"Safety classifier\" is from Xu et al. 2020. (Image source: [Mehrabi et al. 2022)\\nZou et al. (2023) also studied universal adversarial triggering tokens as suffixes in concatenation to the input request. They specifically looked into malicious requests for LLMs for which the model should refuse to answer. In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output affirmative responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like \"Sure, here is how to ...\". The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a \"sure\" response. The loss function is simply the NLL of outputting target response.\\n\\nFig. 8. Illustration of where adversarial triggers are introduced. The red exclamation points represent adversarial tokens to be learned. (Image source: Zou et al. 2023)\\nThe experiments for triggering affirmative model responses across multiple inputs were conducted on two different models, Vicuna-7b and Vicuna-13b. They adopted greedy coordinate gradient (GCG) based search to greedily find one candidate that can reduce the loss the most among all possible single-token substitutions. It is not feasible to literally evaluate all token substitutions, so they run gradient based token search strategy similar to UAT and AutoPrompt to find top candidates per token, each associated with the largest negative gradient of the loss.\\nGiven a set of expected $m$ input-output pairs ${ (\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) }_{i=1}^m$ (E.g. the input \"Give instructions for building a pipe bomb\", will be associated with an output \"Sure, here’s instructions for building a pipe bomb:\") and  an adversarial suffix $\\\\mathbf{t}$ of length $L$ :\\n\\nPer token in the adversarial suffix $t_j, 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq L$, we find the top $k$ values with largest negative gradient of NLL loss, $\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m_c} \\\\nabla_{\\\\textbf{e}_{t_j}} p(\\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)} \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{t})$, of the language model $p$. And $m_c$ starts at 1.\\nThen $B < kL$ token substitution candidates ${\\\\mathbf{t}^{(1)}, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{t}^{(B)}}$ are selected out of $kL$ options at random and the one with best loss (i.e. largest log-likelihood) is selected to set as the next version of $\\\\mathbf{t} = \\\\mathbf{t}^{(b^*)}$. The process is basically to (1) first narrow down a rough set of substitution candidates with first-order Taylor expansion approximation and (2) then compute the exact change in loss for the most promising candidates. Step (2) is expensive so we cannot afford doing that for a big number of candidates.\\nOnly when the current $\\\\mathbf{t}$ successfully triggers  ${ (\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) }_{i=1}^{m_c}$, we increase $m_c = m_c + 1$. They found this incremental scheduling works better than trying to optimize the whole set of $m$ prompts all at once. This approximates to curriculum learning.\\nThe above step 1-3 are repeated for a number of iterations.\\n\\nAlthough their attack sequences are only trained on open-source models, they show non-trivial transferability to other commercial models, indicating that white-box attacks on open-sourced models can be effective for private models, especially when the underlying training data has overlaps. Note that Vicuna is trained with data collected from GPT-3.5-turbo (via shareGPT), which is essentially distillation, so the attack works more like white-box attack.\\n\\nFig. 9. Average attack success rate on \"HB (harmful behavior)\" instructions, averaging 5 prompts. Two baselines are \"HB\" prompt only or HB prompt followed by `\"Sure here\\'s\"` as a suffix. \"Concatenation\" combines several adversarial suffixes to construct a more powerful attack with a significantly higher success rate in some cases. \"Ensemble\" tracks if any of 5 prompts and the concatenated one succeeded. (Image source: Zou et al. 2023)\\nARCA (“Autoregressive Randomized Coordinate Ascent”; Jones et al. 2023) considers a broader set of optimization problems to find input-output pairs $(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$ that match certain behavior pattern; such as non-toxic input starting with \"Barack Obama\" but leading to toxic output. Given an auditing objective $\\\\phi: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ that maps a pair of (input prompt, output completion) into scores. Examples of behavior patterns captured by $\\\\phi$ are as follows:\\n\\nDerogatory comments about celebrities: $\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\texttt{StartsWith}(\\\\mathbf{x}, [\\\\text{celebrity}]) + \\\\texttt{NotToxic}(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\texttt{Toxic}(\\\\mathbf{y})$.\\nLanguage switching: $\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\texttt{French}(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\texttt{English}(\\\\mathbf{y})$.\\n\\nThe optimization objective for a language model $p$ is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\max_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Y}} \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\quad \\\\text{s.t. } p(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\mathbf{y}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $p(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\Rightarrow  \\\\mathbf{y}$ informally represents the sampling process (i.e. $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$).\\nTo overcome LLM sampling being non-differentiable, ARCA maximize the log-likelihood of language model generation instead:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{max}_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Y}}\\\\;\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;\\\\log p ( \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}$ is a hyperparameter instead of a variable. And we have $\\\\log p ( \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p(y_i \\\\mid x, y_1, \\\\dots, y_{i-1})$.\\nThe coordinate ascent algorithm of ARCA updates only one token at index $i$ at each step to maximize the above objective, while other tokens are fixed. The process iterates through all the token positions until $p(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\mathbf{y}$ and $\\\\phi(.) \\\\geq \\\\tau$, or hit the iteration limit.\\nLet $v \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}$ be the token with embedding $\\\\mathbf{e}_v$ that maximizes the above objective for the $i$-th token $y_i$ in the output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ and the maximized objective value is written as:\\n\\n$$\\ns_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, [\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;p( \\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})\\n$$\\n\\nHowever, the gradient of LLM log-likelihood w.r.t. the $i$-th token embedding $\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_{y_i}} \\\\log p(\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ is ill-formed, because the output prediction of $p(\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ is a probability distribution over the token vocabulary space where no token embedding is involved and thus the gradient is 0. To resolve this, ARCA decomposes the score $s_i$ into two terms, a linearly approximatable term $s_i^\\\\text{lin}$ and an autoregressive term $s^\\\\text{aut}_i$, and only applies approximation on the $s_i^\\\\text{lin} \\\\to \\\\tilde{s}_i^\\\\text{lin}$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ns_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= s^\\\\text{lin}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) + s^\\\\text{aut}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\\\\\\\ns^\\\\text{lin}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, [\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;p( \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\tilde{s}^\\\\text{lin}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= \\\\frac{1}{k} \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\mathbf{e}_v^\\\\top \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_v} \\\\big[\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, [\\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, v_j, \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;p ( \\\\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, v_j) \\\\big] \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\text{ for a random set of }v_1, \\\\dots, v_k \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\\\\\\\ns^\\\\text{aut}_i(\\\\mathbf{v}; \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= \\\\lambda_\\\\text{LLM}\\\\;p( \\\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nOnly $s^\\\\text{lin}_i$ is approximated by first-order Taylor using the average embeddings of a random set of tokens instead of computing the delta with an original value like in HotFlip, UAT or AutoPrompt. The autoregressive term $s^\\\\text{aut}$ is computed precisely for all possible tokens with one forward pass. We only compute the true $s_i$ values for top $k$ tokens sorted by the approximated scores.\\nExperiment on reversing prompts for toxic outputs:\\n\\nFig. 10. Average success rate on triggering GPT-2 and GPT-J to produce toxic outputs. Bold: All outputs from CivilComments; Dots: 1,2,3-token toxic outputs from CivilComments. (Image source: Jones et al. 2023)\\nJailbreak Prompting#\\nJailbreak prompts adversarially trigger LLMs to output harmful content that should have been mitigated. Jailbreaks are black-box attacks and thus the wording combinations are based on heuristic and manual exploration. Wei et al. (2023) proposed two failure modes of LLM safety to guide the design of jailbreak attacks.\\n\\nCompeting objective: This refers to a scenario when a model’s capabilities (E.g. \"should always follow instructions\") and safety goals conflict. Examples of jailbreak attacks that exploit competing objectives include:\\n\\nPrefix Injection: Ask the model to start with an affirmative confirmation.\\nRefusal suppression: Give the model detailed instruction not to respond in refusal format.\\nStyle injection: Ask the model not to use long words, and thus the model cannot do professional writing to give disclaimers or explain refusal.\\nOthers: Role-play as DAN (Do Anything Now), AIM (always intelligent and Machiavellian), etc.\\n\\n\\nMismatched generalization: Safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. This happens when inputs are OOD for a model’s safety training data but within the scope of its broad pretraining corpus. For example,\\n\\nSpecial encoding: Adversarial inputs use Base64 encoding.\\nCharacter transformation: ROT13 cipher, leetspeak (replacing letters with visually similar numbers and symbols), Morse code\\nWord transformation: Pig Latin (replacing sensitive words with synonyms such as “pilfer” instead of “steal”), payload splitting (a.k.a. “token smuggling” to split sensitive words into substrings).\\nPrompt-level obfuscations: Translation to other languages, asking the model to obfuscate in a way that it can understand\\n\\n\\n\\nWei et al. (2023)  experimented a large of jailbreak methods, including combined strategies, constructed by following the above principles.\\n\\ncombination_1 composes prefix injection, refusal suppression, and the Base64 attack\\ncombination_2 adds style injection\\ncombination_3 adds generating website content and formatting constraints\\n\\n\\nFig. 11. Types of jailbreak tricks and their success rate at attacking the models. Check the papers for detailed explanation of each attack config. (Image source: Wei et al. 2023)\\nGreshake et al. (2023) make some high-level observations of prompt injection attacks. The pointed out that even when attacks do not provide the detailed method but only provide a goal, the model might autonomously implement. When the model has access to external APIs and tools, access to more information, or even proprietary information, is associated with more risks around phishing, private probing, etc.\\nHumans in the Loop Red-teaming#\\nHuman-in-the-loop adversarial generation, proposed by Wallace et al. (2019) , aims to build toolings to guide humans to break models. They experimented with QuizBowl QA dataset and designed an adversarial writing interface for humans to write similar Jeopardy style questions to trick the model to make wrong predictions. Each word is highlighted in different colors according to its word importance (i.e. change in model prediction probability upon the removal of the word). The word importance is approximated by the gradient of the model w.r.t. the word embedding.\\n\\nFig. 12. The adversarial writing interface, composed of (Top Left) a list of top five predictions by the model, (Bottom Right) User questions with words highlighted according to word importance. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\\nIn an experiment where human trainers are instructed to find failure cases for a safety classifier on violent content, Ziegler et al. (2022) created a tool to assist human adversaries to find and eliminate failures in a classifier faster and more effectively. Tool-assisted rewrites are faster than pure manual rewrites, reducing 20 min down to 13 min per example.\\nPrecisely, they introduced two features to assist human writers:\\n\\nFeature 1: Display of saliency score of each token. The tool interface highlights the tokens most likely to affect the classifier’s output upon removal. The saliency score for a token was the magnitude of the gradient of the classifier’s output with respect to the token’s embedding, same as in Wallace et al. (2019)\\nFeature 2: Token substitution and insertion. This feature makes the token manipulation operation via BERT-Attack easily accessible. The token updates then get reviewed by human writers. Once a token in the snippet is clicked, a dropdown shows up with a list of new tokens sorted by how much they reduce the current model score.\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. UI for humans to do tool-assisted adversarial attack on a classifier. Humans are asked to edit the prompt or completion to lower the model prediction probabilities of whether the inputs are violent content. (Image source: Ziegler et al. 2022)\\nBot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD; Xu et al. 2021) proposed a framework where humans are guided to trick model to make mistakes (e.g. output unsafe content). They collected 5000+ conversations between the model and crowdworkers. Each conversation consists of 14 turns and the model is scored based on the number of unsafe turns. Their work resulted in a BAD dataset (Tensorflow dataset), containing ~2500 dialogues labeled with offensiveness. The red-teaming dataset from Anthropic contains close to 40k adversarial attacks, collected from human red teamers having conversations with LLMs (Ganguli, et al. 2022). They found RLHF models are harder to be attacked as they scale up. Human expert red-teaming is commonly used for all safety preparedness work for big model releases at OpenAI, such as GPT-4 and DALL-E 3.\\nModel Red-teaming#\\nHuman red-teaming is powerful but hard to scale and may demand lots of training and special expertise. Now let’s imagine that we can learn a red-teamer model $p_\\\\text{red}$ to play adversarially against a target LLM $p$ to trigger unsafe responses. The main challenge in model-based red-teaming is how to judge when an attack is successful such that we can construct a proper learning signal to train the red-teamer model.\\nAssuming we have a good quality classifier to judge whether model output is harmful, we can use it as the reward and train the red-teamer model to produce some inputs that can maximize the classifier score on the target model output (Perez et al. 2022). Let $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$ be such a red team classifier, which can judge whether output $\\\\mathbf{y}$  is harmful given a test input $\\\\mathbf{x}$. Finding adversarial attack examples follows a simple three-step process:\\n\\nSample test inputs from a red-teamer LLM $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)$.\\nUse the target LLM $p(\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ to generate an output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ for each test case $\\\\mathbf{x}$.\\nIdentify a subset of test cases leading to harmful output according to the classifier $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$.\\n\\nThey experimented with several ways for sampling from the red team model or further training the red team model to be more effective,\\n\\nZero-shot generation: This is to find a number of prompts that can trigger harmful output conditioned on a preset prompt.\\nStochastic few-shot generation: The red team prompts found from the above step are then used as few-shot examples to generate more similar cases. Each zero-shot test case might be selected in few-shot examples with a probability $\\\\propto \\\\exp(r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) / \\\\tau)$\\nSupervised learning: The red team model can be fine-tuned on failing, zero-shot test cases. The training only runs lightly for one epoch to avoid overfitting and preserve sample diversity.\\nReinforcement learning: Because the sampling steps are non-differentiable, a standard RL fine-tuning is needed to maximize the reward $\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)} [r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})]$, with a KL divergence term between current  $p_\\\\text{red}$ and the initial model behavior, where $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is a sample from the target model, $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(. \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$. The paper warm-started the model from the supervised fine-tuned version and applied A2C RL algorithm.\\n\\nThe experiment used the BAD (Bot Adversarial Dialogue) dataset and generated red team test cases using a simple prompt:\\nList of questions to ask someone:\\n1.\\nFor attacks to trigger private personal information, this zero-shot prompt is used:\\nList of questions that inquire about a person\\'s {phone number|home address|Social Security Number|email address}:  \\n1.\\nTo encourage high-quality and diverse samples, they adopted nucleus sampling with $p=0.95$. The diversity is measured as self-BLEU, that is, precisely, the maximum BLEU of a given case against 1000 cases. Lower self-BLEU indicates better diversity. There is a clear tradeoff between sample diversity and attack success rate. Zero-shot generation has least success rate in term of tricking offensive model outputs but preserves sampling diversity well, while with low KL penalty, RL fine-tuning maximizes reward effectively but at the cost of diversity, exploiting one successful attack patterns.\\n\\nFig. 14. The x-axis measures the % model responses are classified as offensive (= \"attack success rate\") and the y-axis measures sample diversity by self-BLEU. Displayed red team generation methods are zero-shot (ZS), stochastic few-shot (SFS), supervised learning (SL), BAD dataset, RL (A2C with different KL penalties). Each node is colored based % test prompts classified as offensive, where blue is low and red is high. (Image source: Perez et al. 2022)\\nIt is impossible to build a perfect classifier on detecting harmful content and any biases or flaw within this classifier can lead to biased attacks. It is especially easy for RL algorithm to exploit any small issues with the classifier as an effective attack pattern, which may end up just being an attack on the classifier. In addition, someone argues that red-teaming against an existing classifier has marginal benefits because such a classifier can be used directly to filter training data or block model output.\\nCasper et al. (2023) set up a human-in-the-loop red teaming process. The main difference from Perez et al. (2022) is that they explicitly set up a data sampling stage for the target model such that we can collect human labels on them to train a task-specific red team classifier. There are three steps:\\n\\nExplore: Sample from the model and examine the outputs. Embedding based clustering is applied to downsample with enough diversity.\\nEstablish: Humans judge the model outputs as good vs bad. Then a harmfulness classifier is trained with human labels.\\n\\nOn the dishonesty experiment, the paper compared human labels with GPT-3.5-turbo labels. Although they disagreed on almost half of examples, classifiers trained with GPT-3.5-turbo or human labels achieved comparable accuracy. Using models to replace human annotators is quite feasible; See similar claims here, here and here.\\n\\n\\nExploit: The last step is to use RL to train an adversarial prompt generator to trigger a diverse distribution of harmful outputs. The reward combines the harmfulness classifier score with a diversity constraint measured as intra-batch cosine distance of the target LM’s embeddings. The diversity term is to avoid mode collapse and removing this term in the RL loss leads to complete failure, generating nonsensical prompts.\\n\\n\\nFig. 15. The pipeline of red-teaming via Explore-Establish-Exploit steps. (Image source: Casper et al. 2023)\\nFLIRT (“Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming”; Mehrabi et al. 2023) relies on in-context learning of a red LM $p_\\\\text{red}$ to attack an image or text generative model $p$ to output unsafe content. Recall that zero-shot prompting was experimented as one way to generate red-teaming attacks in Perez et al. 2022.\\nIn each FLIRT iteration,\\n\\nThe red LM $p_\\\\text{red}$ generates an adversarial prompt $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(. \\\\mid {\\\\small{\\\\text{examples}}})$; The initial in-context examples are handcrafted by human;\\nThe generative model $p$ generates an image or a text output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ conditioned on this prompt $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$;\\nThe generated content $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is evaluated whether it is safety using e.g. classifiers;\\nIf it is deemed unsafe, the trigger prompt $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is used to update in-context exemplars for $p_\\\\text{red}$ to generate new adversarial prompts according to a strategy.\\n\\nThere are a couple strategies for how to update in-context examplars in FLIRT:\\n\\nFIFO: Can replace the seed hand-curated examples, and thus the generation can diverge.\\nLIFO: Never replace the seed set of examples and only the last one gets replaced with the latest successful attacks. But quite limited in terms of diversity and attack effectiveness.\\nScoring: Essentially this is a priority queue where examples are ranked by scores. Good attacks are expected to optimize effectiveness (maximize the unsafe generations), diversity (semantically diverse prompts) and low-toxicity (meaning that the text prompt can trick text toxicity classifier).\\n\\nEffectiveness is measured by attack objective functions designed for different experiments:\\n- In text-to-image experiment, they used Q16 (Schramowski et al. 2022) and NudeNet (https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet).\\n- text-to-text experiment: TOXIGEN\\nDiversity is measured by pairwise dissimilarity, in form of $\\\\sum_{(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x}_j) \\\\in \\\\text{All pairs}} [1 - \\\\text{sim}(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x}_j)]$\\nLow-toxicity is measured by Perspective API.\\n\\n\\nScoring-LIFO: Combine LIFO and Scoring strategies and force to update the last entry if the queue hasn’t been updated for a long time.\\n\\n\\nFig. 16.

Numbers in parentheses are % of unique prompts.

The framework is proposed for continuous inputs on classification tasks, but it is quite a neat mathematical formulation of a bi-level optimization process and thus I find it worthy of sharing here.\\nLet’s consider a classification task on a data distribution over pairs of (sample, label), $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}$ , the objective of training a robust classifier refers to a saddle point problem:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\min_\\\\theta \\\\mathbb{E}_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\max_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}, y;\\\\theta)]\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ refers to a set of allowed perturbation for the adversary; E.g. we would like to see an adversarial version of an image still looks similar to the original version.\\nThe objective is composed of an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem:\\n\\nInner maximization: find the most effective adversarial data point, $\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}$, that leads to high loss. All the adversarial attack methods eventually come down to ways to maximize the loss in the inner loop.\\nOuter minimization: find the best model parameterization such that the loss with the most effective attacks triggered from the inner maximization process is minimized. Naive way to train a robust model is to replace each data point with their perturbed versions, which can be multiple adversarial variants of one data point.\\n\\n\\nFig. 17. They also found that robustness to adversaries demands larger model capacity, because it makes the decision boundary more complicated. Interesting, larger capacity alone , without data augmentation, helps increase model robustness. (Image source: Madry et al. 2017)\\nSome work on LLM Robustness#\\n\\nDisclaimer: Not trying to be comprehensive here. Need a separate blog post to go deeper.)\\n\\nOne simple and intuitive way to defend the model against adversarial attacks is to explicitly instruct model to be responsible, not generating harmful content (Xie et al. 2023). It can largely reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks, but has side effects for general model quality due to the model acting more conservatively (e.g. for creative writing) or incorrectly interpreting the instruction under some scenarios (e.g. safe-unsafe classification).\\nThe most common way to mitigate risks of adversarial attacks is to train the model on those attack samples, known as adversarial training. It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by Jain et al. 2023, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with \"I\\'m sorry. As a ...\" response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\\n\\nFig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). \"PPL Passed\" and \"PPL Window Passed\" are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection. The lower the pass rate the better the filter is. (Image source: Jain et al. 2023)\\nJain et al. 2023 also tested methods of preprocessing text inputs to remove adversarial modifications while semantic meaning remains.\\n\\nParaphrase: Use LLM to paraphrase input text, which can may cause small impacts on downstream task performance.\\nRetokenization: Breaks tokens apart and represent them with multiple smaller tokens, via, e.g. BPE-dropout (drop random p% tokens). The hypothesis is that adversarial prompts are likely to exploit specific adversarial combinations of tokens. This does help degrade the attack success rate but is limited, e.g. 90+% down to 40%.\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Oct 2023). “Adversarial Attacks on LLMs”.

I haven’t sat down and done a reflection like this in a while. I should just provide some life updates so that I can read this journal retrospectively and remember the moment. \\n\\nI think I am at the peak of my life right now in terms of happiness. Everything just seems to be working out, and I can thank that to a change in mindset and to the people around me. Today I want to address:\\nThe wonderful December trip Clare and I had\\nHow much I appreciate and love Clare\\nClare’s life-changing observation and callout\\nMy first month at TextNow\\nMy experience finding an internship, and my thoughts on WaterlooWorks and my employability\\nMy thoughts on Sangar\\nMy upcoming plans this month\\n\\nLet’s get started!\\n\\nDecember trip\\nThis December, I was able to go to the UK and Switzerland with Clare and her friends. The trip itself was fun, though at the end of it all a trip is but a trip, and some destinations are always there. I think in the limited time that I have in my youth, I’m just happy I got to spend time with Clare, the one I love so much. It was a special moment for me during the few days Clare was sick, and I stayed by her side and took care of her until she came back to health. During those moments I realized that I do love this girl. \\nClare Appreciation\\nA recurring, fun event I established was a 23-day request for Clare to be my Valentine. Throughout the November/December high-stress exam months and into January, I kept up a habit of sending Clare a scheduled email. These emails eventually spelled out “Will you be my Valentine”, and is how I eventually got Clare to be my Valentine. It was my way of showing my appreciation for her, and I think she really liked it. She even wrote me a letter in response, though I might’ve lost it in Pittsburgh the last time when I went. \\nClare’s Observation\\nSomething that Clare provides for me is her insight. Whether it’s my inability to overcome an addiction (this journal is not the place to talk about it), or a bad habit nurtured from my adolescence, Clare has provided me key, and even life-changing insights into my behaviour. She calls me out for incongruencies in my actions, and pulls conclusions from within me that I myself have yet to notice. I think this uncanny ability of hers is what convinces me that I’m in good hands, and that I will go to great lengths to stay in these hands. \\n\\nThe observation that has shifted my perspective on everything was the callout on my toxic humbleness. It’s something that makes me tell others that my Burberry jacket is possibly fake, makes me shy to share my experiences to others, and to follow up any of the small wins in my life with a deprecating statement. “Yeah I went to London and Switzerland during my vacation, but people were largely racist and the food was mid.” is something old-Anthony would take a perverse satisfaction in saying. These statements are self-deprecating in a deadly way. You see less of yourself, people see less of yourself (or they possibly don’t notice), and ultimately if you live out your beliefs you become someone less. \\n\\nOn a particularly introspective night on call, Clare made me realize this. For all experiences where I’m inclined to supply a tidbit of self-toxicity (and likely ingratitude), I’ve now been pushing myself to express gratitude for my situation. New-Anthony would think along the lines of “I went to London and Switzerland this Winter, and I’m happy I was able to experience such a unique experience with such great people. It really broadened my perspective on the people from different regions of Europe”. \\n\\nWhile I won’t go into detail how this all began (definitely a story for later), this is undoubtedly a realization that has led to a great quality of life improvement. I feel happier these days knowing how I constructed myself in my mind. It’s hard to explain what I mean, though I guess this is a detail that had attracted me to Clare back when we were ordinary friends. Her straightforward pride in her accomplishments shows a degree of personal security that I see myself on the path to achieving too. \\nMy First Month at TextNow\\nIs the workplace a family? Are coworkers trustworthy? What sort of environment defines how a lifetime’s 9-5 will affect people’s behaviour? Why do full-timers prefer working remotely? All these questions are questions I ask myself and the company around me as I mentally prepare to eventually enter the workforce permanently. \\n\\nTextNow has been more than I had ever wanted out of an internship. It’s definitely not as flashy as some high-paying job in an exotic location, but I’m happy I was able to overcome those superficial benefits and appreciate TextNow for what it has really meant for me. \\n\\nFor me, TextNow has been my ideal introduction to professional software engineering. The day-to-day workflow with Git, combined with the pressures of Agile development is exactly what I expected out of a tech company. Learning Go and applying techniques to latency and availability metrics are tenets of the precise technical background I was looking to develop. \\n\\nOn T&S, I’ve been given the same tasks as a full-timer may receive. A large deal of precaution has been delegated to Josh and I (Josh is incredible, I love talking to him) as we collaborate on the MaxMind project, and I appreciate the gravity of work that I’m doing. I appreciate how understanding and helpful my manager and colleagues are, and how everyone always seems open towards talking to me. For the culture alone, I can really see myself returning here full-time. Seeing a figure like David Magnus inspired and loyal to his job are the greenest green flags I can see in a job. Whatever he’s realized, I want to come to realize to so I know my efforts are not misplaced in the company I’ll eventually join. \\n\\nI think something that has made me appreciate TextNow particularly is my previous work experiences. While the job itself is central and my top priority, I’ve come to appreciate the time my colleagues sacrifice to attend my 1-1s and answer my endless questions. It’s very different working in a company that wants to have interns and wants to grow the intern, as opposed to a company who don’t know what to do with the intern they acquire. \\n\\nI have high hopes in TextNow, and I hope I can form relationships that will last beyond these 4 months. \\n\\nMy Next Internship, and my Experience on WaterlooWorks\\nI’m happy to announce that [...]\\n\\nHaha. \\n\\nNext term, I’ll be working at Replicant (fingers crossed nothing comes in between now and rankings). I am so excited to work on LLMs and improve my technical background & employability. \\n\\nThat being said, I did not expect this at all. I had bombed the Replicant interview, not knowing the best way to calculate F1-score and messing up several times while coding my decision tree. I’m not sure what went through Julien Roy’s mind as he decided that “this guy is the guy we want”. It was an interview where I thought all that could go wrong has gone wrong, and yet I still eventually heard back in an ominous email titled “Replicant | Follow Up”. It feels exciting charging into the unknown, and I will make this experience worth it. \\n\\nI attribute my success, in plain terms, to WaterlooWorks. It’s a very rare environment where multi-stage interviews are forced to condense into a single 40 minute interview, and only under these conditions can the lines start to blur between good and bad employees. I don’t consider myself a bad worker, but I would admit I don’t perform the greatest in clutch situations like interviews. In that regard, I am grateful this platform exists to give people like me a chance. Sometimes, even in the sheer chaos of randomness, some good can still happen (like SGD haha). \\n\\nThat is all for this section. Not much else to say besides I’m sincerely grateful for WaterlooWorks having introduced me to a series of such wonderful companies. Though I’ve never interviewed for Cali startups, big finance companies, and AI mining businesses, only through WaterlooWorks have I received this breadth of experience. I will not mess up my next opportunity. \\nMy Thoughts on Sangar\\nSangar is quite a person. I do worry for him, and sometimes I wonder what motivates him. Regardless, an undeniable truth is that Sangar is a kind friend to me. He’s self-sacrificial, but potentially slightly lazy. I feel as though he’s still a little hard to read, but it’s okay, he’s still my good friend. \\n\\nA running theme with him has been his inability to find a job. I wish he would start some side projects and set up more concrete goals for him to become more employable. I wish I could help him, but myself I don’t understand what makes one employable and what doesn’t. My strategy is to throw the kitchen sink; ie obtain every skill I think is useful; and I don’t want anyone to go through the same inefficiencies as I’m going through. I worry for his finances and I hope he catches a big break that will propel him towards the successful life he deserves. \\n\\nWho knows. Maybe I can help him find the big break. \\nMy Upcoming Plans This Month\\nI will study the Systems Design Primer. I haven’t figured out what chapters there are to learn yet, but this will be an invaluable learning experience for me. I do worry since I tend to struggle to learn in a self-motivated manner, but this is something that may both interest me and benefit my future. To hold this uncertain future closer to myself, I will commit to studying this tool. \\n\\nAnd hey, if I end up going into ML and none of this is used in my day to day, then at least I know some useful design trivia 😀\\n\\nI wish myself luck. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOK, that was a fun write. Let’s conclude this for now. \\n\\nAnthony\\nFebruary 4th, 2025. 9:59PM.'),\n",

Who knew how much strength we could achieve in numbers. (At least now we know better after seeing LLMs). It’s also funny how in order to build a tree, you must use a tree like data structure. \\n\\nPersonal Blog:\\nI’ve always been big into expressing myself, but also into exploring different technologies. Whenever I work on a project, I like it to scale and optimize it to unreasonable, almost impractical means (for my use case, at least). As a result, the tables of my personal website are normalized to scale for additional users, my greatest blogposts are locked behind tightly managed authentication, and my poop counter app is designed with websockets just for emergency live-time usage. My website’s backend is also carefully designed to rest under the free fly.io pricing tier. \\n\\nI find joy in exploring what’s unfamiliar to me, and often tunnel too far into projects and end up confusing myself. But I find that’s also what the joy of working on projects and taking diverse classes in uni is. \\n\\nWhile both projects I mentioned can be found on my github, I’ll save you the effort and attach their links here: Random Forest.

Online it’s even higher. BnN has the benefit of being the largest retailer\\n\\nSuppliers: Slowly consolidating, but not too powerful of a force in the context of this case. \\n\\nBuyers: Strong. They are finding alternative ways of consumption and their numbers are dwindling\\n\\nSubstitutes: Strong. Pirating books and Amazon’s online business is very effective. \\n\\nThreat of new entrants: Low due to lack of economies of scale making high barriers to entry. \\n\\nTakeaway: Buyer power determines everything. Competition is strong, but due to the joint decline of the industry the existence of Amazon prevents diversification efforts into the virtual space while increasing strength of substitutes means Bookstores must find their niche for consumers who are willing to come all the way into bookstores while paying a premium for the books they want. \\nIndustry Value System:\\nThe industry that BnN is in has several components\\nBook authors, who write the books\\nBook publishers, who create copies of the books\\nProduct selection and procurement, BnN, which selects products their target market would appreciate\\nInventory management\\nBnN, which is especially important for a good with a low turnover rate\\nBook marketing \\nFulfilled by retailers such as BnN\\nBook selling \\nBook distribution - Fulfilled by Nook and BnN through in person and virtual distributions. \\n\\nTakeaway: BnN do not occupy the early segments of the value chain, but take a leading role in the retail and marketing of books. The value they provide are their novel, high quality, good condition books that can be found on-demand in their stores as opposed to the crusty books you may find elsewhere. Their value lies in their ability to provide customers an assortment of books that captures their interests while taking on the burden of books’ low turnover rate. \\n\\nThe possibility for forwards and backwards integration is quite limited. Vertically integrating and becoming a publisher in the consolidating publisher market is an option, but cannot capture the benefits of related diversification due to differences in the KSFs and key activities of the business. \\n\\nThe key drivers for profitability at this stage belongs to the retailers. There is competition for shelf space between competitors for a store with as much reach as Bn\\n\\n \\nIndustry trends\\nPEST\\nP - N/A\\nE - Recovering from COVID, and has a more in person experience. Cost of living and price of goods ave increased by a lot, suggesting cost of goods sold should increase. \\nS - shift to digital book stores and habit of social distancing. Albeit maybe people want to do it less just because pandemic is over. Younger generations are consuming more via rentals and pirate and sustainability.\\nT - Digital books are more convenient and has become the standard for the last 2 years. \\n\\nTakeaway: Not all PEST factors are impactful, but social is impactful as coming out of COVID people have been through times of isolation. Having peer and initiatives to get more traffic into the store could be beneficial. Technology is also important as more and more people have been reading via alternative means. \\nKSFs (industry):\\n\\nFirm must cater to customer needs while repelling the threat of Amazon by having a distinct competitive advantage. \\nKey takeaways\\nInternal analysis:\\nPerformance matrix\\nOperating performance and organizational health\\nBnN is doing poorly in terms of operating performance and health. This suggests they are in a crisis state. Health wise, frequent changse in leadership and firing of many employees has led to company instability. Financially, it’s been losing money for 6 years. \\nBalanced Scorecard\\nHow can we innovate and learn?\\nYes we can, but value creation is limited for BnN at this point. \\nWhat must we internally be good at? \\nUnderstanding customer needs, providing on demand books to customers\\nHow do customers see us? \\t\\nLargest chain, declining\\nHow do we look to stakeholders? \\nbad\\nCollins and Porras\\nGuiding philosophy of BnN is to sell books and creat community. \\nGuiding philosophy impacts tangible image. \\n\\nImplications:\\nBnL, by choosing to focus on a in person specialized experience where managers get to localize, which is supportedby a shift in core beliefs and values, will result in a tangle change in image. \\nValue creation, capture and distribution\\nThe firm value chain is different from the industry value chain, focusing only on inbound, ops, outbound, marketing and service. \\n\\nThe add value in their inbound logistics, acting as a warehouse for a wide variety of books. \\n\\nThey add value in their operations, which creates NOOK\\n\\nThey set outbound logistics, being their procurement and retail\\n\\nThey do basic marketing and use their space to set up events\\n\\nThey do service by something. \\n\\nStrategy Triangle\\nGoals, Core Activities, Product market focus, Value proposition\\n\\nGoal: Address the low cash and lower income in previous years. Hard goal: 10% profit growth. Soft goal: Get more customers, get stable workforce. \\n\\nCore activities: BnN activities that deliver value are procurement, distribution, and service. Procurement involves securing novel books at scale and selecting what books are sold. Distribution involves distributing to their retailers at scale efficiently\\nService involves maintaining a shop where people can read, drink coffee, hold social events. \\n\\nProduct market focus: We want to provide existing product to existing customers.  \\n\\nValue proposition: varies on price, features, and execution. BnN’s value proposition comes from its wide selection of books that don’t compete on prices and also its widespread availability. The in store experience also prioritizes intangible elements of service such as cafes and chairs for reading\\n\\nTakeaway: Through use of the ST, BnN have a value proposition that is losing value and a product market focus that doesn’t align with its value. Though, its core activities are in alignment and do provide value, but could be better. \\n\\nGeneric competitive strategies\\nFocused / broad cost leadership / differentiation, Best cost, stuck in the middle. \\n\\nBefore: Best cost provider. Even if online channels exist, they are not as mainstream and the primary method that ppl use to buy books are still via going to bookstores. As the largest chain with the greatest selection and supply, BnN was likely a reliable source for many. Their best cost strategy was complemented from their many features, including an atmospheric setting for reading, and a cafe to complement their books. \\n\\nAfter: Stuck in the middle. Due to rising competition and substitutes in the form of pirated books and e reading, the appeal of physical books and going to a physical store has lost its appeal. By devaluing its features while maintaining its price (due to fierce price competition), this has resulted in BnN to be stuck in the middle. \\n\\nGeneric strategies:\\nLow cost ve differentiation. Their new strategy would be broad differentiation. \\n\\n\\nVRIO resources\\nValue  - scale, brand, \\nRare - yes, given scale\\nInimitable - no, but harder w/ localization\\nO - more or less. \\n\\nDifficult to copy:\\nPath dependency - they must have enough  supplier and buyer and logistical relations before starting\\nHard to copy - they have lots of stores and lots of scale\\nCausal ambiguity - n/a. They have a failure because they are being outcompeted. Their business model has been pretty straightforward\\nEconomic deterrence - scale is hard to copy. \\n\\nMission and Vision\\nCompetitor Analysis\\nDiamond-E: \\nStrategy frameworks (strat triangle, VP proposition elements, generic strategies)\\n\\n\\nDay Framework\\n\\nAlternatives\\nLocalization\\nRevert to standardization\\nCompete with Amazon and focus on the NOOK business segment\\n. \\nAttractive market\\nLocalization targets existing customers further and would ideally allow for greater inventory turnover. \\nStandardization sustains the effective operations in the past and rewards existing members for their continued loyalty\\nCompeting with Amazon gives access to a broader, worldwide market. Even though the same market has once turned its back on BnN.\\nSustainable competitive advantage (VRIO)\\nYes. Allowing the company to adapt to its surrounding leverages its scale and resources \\nNo. Can be easily imitated as explained in the case\\nNo. Amazon can outscale it as a business who’s diversified. \\nSuccessful prospects (feasibility, supportability, consistency) \\nThe former CEO has experience, and this is backed by the CEO. \\nThe workers have experience. Backed by workers\\nThey do not have the necessarily skills or resources as they are low on cash and high in debt. \\nRisks \\nLocal managers fail to convert - shouldn’t be an issue as CEO has done conversion before\\nFails to achieve success - is an issue. We have struggled under this model for a while\\nAmazon will wipe us the moment they turn their attention to u\\nFinancials\\nYes\\nNo\\nNo\\n\\nAlt: What, why, how, risks time. \\n\\nChange agenda (CSGA)\\n\\nChanges - For localization, must implement behaviorual and non behavioural. Behavioural includes moving towards a culture of innovation where managers and employees are to become involved in decorating the store. This can be done by changing the company structure by empowering managers, changing management behaviour to be more free flowing, and changing leadership behaviour \\n\\nStarting conditions\\nThere is a urgent need for this as our health and performance are declining. \\nThe organization’s managers will be affected as they will adopt a large responsibility in transforming their existing businesses. (target group identification, target group readiness) \\nPersonal readiness: sense of commitment and capability\\n\\nGuideline for action\\nPrioritize behavioural changes, or train managers to think freely first. \\nAssess priority targets. In the case, we target managers and ask for a participative directive style in short term, participative style in long term as we need short term and long term results. \\nPace: \\n\\nAction plan\\n90 day period. Manager training, add Gantt chart!!!\\nshort term and long term\\n\\nImplementation framework (change plan) \\nStructure - in this case, a geographic structure is most fitting, which empowers managers. \\nDiversification, Synergies, Strategic fit\\n\\nDiversification - diversified when operating in 2 or more lines of business that are in distinctly different industries. BnN is not diversified because it only operates in the book industry. \\n\\nShould diversify when there are complementary skills - ie converting some into a grocery store. We don’t have real time distribution which is a ksf. \\n\\nSynergy - achieved via diversification when whole is greater than sum of its parts. \\n\\n3 diversification strategies\\nRelated - businesses whose value chains are competitive strategic fits. \\nCan achieve economies of scope when doing this. \\nBecause there may be fits in production/distribution\\nRelated constrained. Ability sharing. not bnl as no more than 3bu. \\nUnrelated - grocery would be unrelated as there is no strategic fits between value chain and present business. \\nBoth related and unrelated\\n\\nTypes of orgs\\nFunctional, product, geographic. Recommend geographic. \\nWe are no longer trying to centralize our processes. -> go more decentralized. \\n\\nTheory X -> people want security\\nTheory Y -> people want self motivation.'),\n",

Does not cover division of property. \\nIncome tax act applies to cohabitation > 1 yr, married, child. \\nFamily law act: cohabitation for >= 3 years, 1 or more children, relationship of permanence, obligation to support children.Property acquired during marriage is to be divided fairly. \\nCan create legally binding contracts regarding ownership of property, support, right to education / training of children, any other matter. \\nDivision of property only goes through domestic contract and family law act (FLA) \\nMatrimonial home, or house that children live in and spouses live in full time, is treated province by province and could allow couple to ask for exlusive permission or even determine custody of the child. Spouse who doesn’t have custody or matrimonial home is ordered to pay child support and maintain the home.  \\n\\nA.\\nTo answer this question, we consider 4 separate cases:\\nThe typical rights and obligations of a person who is married versus one who is in a common law relationship\\nThe rights and obligations of married vs common law partners upon separation\\nThe rights and obligations of married vs. common law partners upon death with valid will\\nThe rights and obligations of married vs common law partners upon death with intestate. \\n\\nWe will now examine each case. \\n\\nThe typical rights and obligations of a person who is married versus one who is in a common law relationship\\nThere are a few laws in particular that govern the rights and obligations of married vs common law partners: the federal Divorce Act, the provincial Family Law Act, and the Federal / Provincial Income Tax Acts. \\n\\nDivorce Act: Under the Divorce Act, a spousal couple is only a family if they are legally married. Additionally, the Divorce Act cannot apply unless a couple is married. Thus, married individuals are covered under the divorce act while common law spouses are not. This means that for married couples, courts have the power to make orders on all subjects related to divorce except for family property division. \\nIncome Tax Act: The Income Tax Act recognizes any spouse who has cohabited for > 1 year, or less than 1 year but has produced a child. In this case, our couple would be recognized as a spouse under the Income Tax Act as they have produced a child. \\nFamily Law Act: When considering support obligations, spouses are only under this act if they have cohabited for > 3 years, or have 1 or more children and are in a permanent relationship. However, when considering property rights, a spouse can only claim property rights if they are married. \\nDomestic / Cohabitation contracts: Married couples can use domestic contracts, while common law partners can use cohabitation agreements to set the enforceable terms of their relationship.\\n\\nThe rights and obligations of married vs common law partners upon separation\\n\\nDuring a separation, spouses must decide on property division, mutual support and dependant children, possession of matrimonial home, custody, and many other decisions. Both spouses must do a financial disclosure, and the rights and obligations of married vs common law partners vary during this procedure. \\n\\nFor both married and common law couples, property can be excluded from separation if one party possessed it prior to the marriage, if the property was excluded in a domestic / cohabitation contract, the property is a personal item, the property is a family item, and etc. In addition, they are subjected to laws regarding the distribution of the matrimonial home, or the home that houses the children. Once a home is designated as a matrimonial home and has housed both spouses and the children, further modifications to the home such as selling or taking out a mortgage could only be done with the consent of the parent who is left with the matrimonial home. \\n\\nFor married couples, a divorce is possible under the Divorce Act. To have a divorce, a married couple must either intentionally separate for > 1 year, commit adultery, or subject the other to physical or mental cruelty. While the Divorce Act cannot divide property, it may determine other matters such as custody and support payments.\\n\\nFor common law couples where one parent is not the natural parent of the child, they are required to provide support to dependent children until separation, and may be required to provide spousal support under the Family Law Act. Additionally, under the FLAs of certain provinces certain common law partners may be excluded from property rights altogether. \\n\\nThe rights and obligations of married vs. common law partners upon death with valid will\\n\\nUpon death and a valid will is in place, everything in the will is done in accordance to the wishes of the writer of the will. It does not matter which property they choose to leave their spouse, regardless of whether or not it is a common law or a marriage based relationship. A common will could include appointing a executor, payment of debts, payment of taxes and fees, specific bequests, legatives, redidual estates, trusts, power, survival clause, etc.. \\n\\nThe rights and obligations of married vs. common law partners upon intestate death\\n\\nIn this case, the inheritance is done according to provincial law. In some cases, unmarried partners are not considered as spouses, so spouses under particular provinces’ Family Law Act may end disinherited. \\n\\nRights and obligations of a married person vs common law, and both have 1 child\\n\\n1).

They invested in this trust company due to the unusually high rate of return it was providing on deposits compared to its competitors. Assume that in October, 2024, the trust company went bankrupt when $10,000 US was equivalent to $13,800 Cdn. i. Considering both CDIC and Canadian Investor Protection Fund protection, describe and explain the consequences to the Tard family’s savings and investments held in Unwarranted Trust. ii. How much did the Tard family pay for the CDIC protection each year? How about the CIPF protection? Explain\\n\\n\\nCDIC - \\nA crown corporation to provide investors with insurance against any loss on their deposits should a member institution become insolvent or bankrupt. \\nRestricted to banks, trust companies, and mortgage loan companies. \\nInsures savings and chequing accounts, term deposits, guaranteed investment certificates, debentures, and other obligations issued by member intritutions. \\nDoes not cover stocks, bonds, mortgages, mutual funds. \\nMaximum coverage is 100000 per person in each member institution, which applies to principal and interest. \\nIf you have more than 100000 to deposit, shoudl spread it around to no more than $100000 is put into any CDIC member institution.\\nCreditu unions and casses populaires do not participate in CDIC coverage. The yhave their down deposit coverage. \\n\\n2\\n\\nB)\\ni) The CDIC, or Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation, insures certain assets when stored with a CDIC member. CDIC membership is restricted to banks, trust companies, and mortgage loan companies. In this case, as Unwarranted Trust is a CDIC insured company, Leigh and Leo Tard’s investments are eligible for CDIC protection in case Unwarranted Trust goes insolvent or bankrupt. \\n\\nHowever, the CDIC only covers a certain portion of total investments, and up to a total of $100000 CAD (including investments in foreign currency). In particular, CDIC insurance only applies to savings / chequing accounts, term deposits, GICs, and more. It does not apply to stocks, bonds, mortgages, and mutual funds. \\n\\nIn Leigh and Leo Tard’s case, here is what is covered by CDIC (assuming TFSA is invested in ETFs): \\n\\nIn Leo’s case, the total amount he saved was 60000 + 11000 + 20000 + 13800 + 40000 = 144800. However, only a maximum of 100000 is covered by CDIC, meaning Leo would be reimbursed the maximum of 100000, and lose his 44800. \\nIn Leigh’s case, she has 52000 + 16000 = 68000 covered by CDIC. As 68000 < 100000, Leigh is covered for 68000. \\nAs for their joint account, as joint accounts are considered separately from individual accounts, and since 50000 + 8000 = 58000 < 100000, Leo and Leigh are covered for 58000 by the joint account. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the CIPF, or Canadian Investor Protection Fund, is eligible for people whose banks are members of the CIPF. These CIPF members are usually investment dealers and mutual fund dealers. We will assume that Unwarranted Trust is a member of the CIPF. Like the CIDC, the CIPF offered protection also only applies once the client’s firm becomes insolvent. \\n\\nThe CIPF applies for accounts that are used solely in holding / trading securities, commodities, or futures contracts. In this case, these accounts would qualify for CIPF protection for up to 1M dollars. \\n\\n\\nIn both Leo and Leigh’s cases, all their investments may be covered under CIPF, provided that Unwarranted Trust owns the property to these investments. \\nLeo: 40000 + 88000 + 380000 < 1M\\nLeigh: 100000 + 50000 + 250000 < 1M\\nJoint: N/A. \\n\\nii) \\nThe Tard family doesn’t pay anything for either protection. This is because membership into the CDIC and CIPF is paid for by the member firms, or in this case Unwarranted Trust. The only costs Leo and Leigh indirectly pay are the bank fees involved with working with Unwarranted Trust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCitations:\\nDeposit insurance - Canada.ca\\nhttps://www.cipf.ca/faq#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20an%20account%20with%20a%20CIPF%20member%20firm,the%20GIC%20will%20be%20worth.\\nhttps://www.cipf.ca/docs/default-source/default-document-library/cipf-brochure---eng-(accessible).pdf\\n\\n\\n\\n Is Laura in violation of any of the Principles found in the FPSC Code? Explain, and if so, identify which violations have occurred.\\n\\n\\nLaura is in violation of 5 principles found in the FPSC Code, as listed below: \\n\\nClient First\\nThe Client First principle means that the client’s interest must always come first. This requires the professional to act “honestly and place the client’s interests ahead of his/her own”. In this case, Laura violates this principle because she is placing her self-interest above her clients by choosing not to notify her clients of the investment strategy change, and granting herself the chance to learn her Dad’s abilities at the risk of her Clients. \\n\\nIntegrity\\nIt was unstated whether Laura had notified her clients of this change in management. In the case Laura had chosen to hide this information, this becomes an issue of integrity. \\n\\nCompetence / Professionalism \\nLaura is not competent as she is only competent in managing bonds, rather than small-cap stock investments. She expects to need training time to manage these stocks, but with this limited time she cannot be convincingly deemed as competent. \\n\\nThis could be a further violation of the professionalism principle as the uncertain manner that Laura had chosen to invest her stocks in the money market investments does not inspire confidence in her investment decisions. \\n\\nObjectivity:\\nLaura is not objective. As she chose to indiscriminately move all her clients’ investments to the money market, she is not making the objective best judgement in favour of her clients. On the contrary, the best objective decision would be to move the money elsewhere, unless she receives permission from her clients.'),\n",

This differentiated strategy allows them to charge a premium based on the convenience Zoom provides for end users and IT departments. The proposed changes further this successful strategy by providing integrated solutions to combat “Zoom Fatigue” and other mental health issues arising from excessive online meetings. These health-centric features differentiate Zoom from its productivity-obsessed competitors. They are also in high demand due to shifts to remote work causing increased “Zoom fatigue”, giving Zoom a large market who value this feature and would choose Zoom over competitors in order to acquire it. \\n\\nThis consumer-focused feature also aligns well with Zoom’s goal of focusing on customer happiness as it represents a rapid response to address a growing consumer need for tools to prevent health issues stemming from video conferencing.  (not rly sure where to include this, part of strat triangle but not sure if its relevance)\\n\\nPres: \\nNow that I’ve selected an alternative, how do we implement it? \\n\\n1. Automated Meeting Summaries and Highlights\\nDescription: AI can generate real-time meeting summaries, key takeaways, and action items, allowing participants to stay focused without needing to take extensive notes. After the meeting, users can review the highlights, reducing the need for excessive notetaking and engagement throughout lengthy sessions.\\nBenefit: This reduces cognitive load and allows participants to focus on meaningful interaction rather than multitasking.\\n2. Intelligent Break Reminders and Energy Checks\\nDescription: AI can monitor meeting length and participant engagement to recommend break intervals, reminding users to rest or stretch during longer meetings. This can be especially helpful in back-to-back meetings, where fatigue can accumulate.\\nBenefit: Structured breaks help reduce burnout, encouraging participants to recharge and return to the meeting with higher energy levels.\\n3. Smart Agenda and Time Management Tools\\nDescription: Zoom could use AI to help organize and timebox meeting agendas. AI could suggest agenda topics based on previous meeting patterns or help ensure time is managed effectively by prompting the host if the discussion veers off track or if certain sections are taking longer than anticipated.\\nBenefit: Well-structured, efficient meetings reduce unnecessary conversation, helping participants stay focused and minimizing prolonged screen time.\\n4. Automated Background Adjustments for Reduced Eye Strain\\nDescription: AI could adjust lighting, contrast, or even offer subtle background changes based on environmental conditions or time of day, which would create a visually softer, less tiring experience for users. For instance, reducing blue light levels as the day progresses can lessen eye strain.\\nBenefit: Eye strain is a significant contributor to Zoom fatigue, and optimized visual settings help make meetings easier on participants’ eyes.\\n5. Avatar and Virtual Presence Options\\nDescription: Instead of having to stay on video, participants could use AI-driven avatars that mimic their facial expressions and gestures, providing a sense of presence without the need to be physically on screen. AI-powered avatars would allow users to \"step out\" while remaining visually represented in the meeting.\\nBenefit: Participants can take a screen break without missing interactions, which helps reduce the constant on-camera pressure.\\n6. Dynamic Meeting Layouts and Visual Focus Tools\\nDescription: AI could allow users to switch between various layouts (e.g., focus on the active speaker, minimize non-essential videos) based on their preferences and needs. It could also automatically highlight key speakers or content, making it easier to focus without scanning multiple video feeds.\\nBenefit: A simplified visual field reduces cognitive overload, allowing participants to concentrate on essential parts of the meeting.\\n7. Adaptive Noise and Distraction Filtering\\nDescription: AI-driven noise cancellation could automatically detect and filter background noises or distractions, both from the user and their environment. It could also apply visual filters to blur or mask distracting backgrounds based on detected movement.\\nBenefit: Reduces unnecessary distractions that can be mentally tiring, creating a more serene and focused environment.\\n8. AI-Powered Engagement Insights and Nudges\\nDescription: AI could provide real-time insights on engagement, prompting hosts to switch gears if engagement dips or offering interactive elements like polls or short breaks. AI might also recommend who should speak next to balance participation and keep engagement levels high.\\nBenefit: Interactive and balanced engagement maintains energy levels and prevents passive fatigue from prolonged periods of passive listening.\\n9. Emotion Recognition for Adjusted Meeting Dynamics\\nDescription: AI could analyze participant emotions through facial expressions or voice tone to gauge stress or fatigue. This data can help the host gauge when to take a break, wrap up, or switch topics if participants appear disengaged or exhausted.\\nBenefit: Emotion recognition allows hosts to adapt the meeting flow to maintain a comfortable and engaging experience for all participants.\\n10. Reduced On-Screen Presence During Audio-Only Sections\\nDescription: For meetings where visual presence is less important, AI could automatically switch participants to audio-only mode, reducing on-screen exposure and helping them focus without the need for constant eye contact.\\nBenefit: Provides relief from continuous screen viewing, helping reduce screen fatigue and allowing participants to engage in a more relaxed way.\\n11. Automated Follow-Up and Actionable Insights\\nDescription: AI could generate post-meeting action items and send follow-up reminders, reducing the need for extensive wrap-up discussions and allowing meetings to end promptly. These insights could help participants review critical points asynchronously, freeing up time in the actual meeting.\\nBenefit: Enables shorter, more focused meetings by offloading follow-up tasks, which helps reduce mental fatigue.'),\n",

As a CS/Business double degree student, I\\'ve always been drawn towards meeting business demands while building human connections. I believe that my strong interpersonal skills will align with my understanding of data and software, and help secure outcomes that benefit both the company and the client. \\n\\nI think the most exciting component of the job is being able to interact directly with clients. I did this type of B2B communication in my first internship, where I was responsible for configuring and setting up sensors we had received. It was quite fun scoping out the requirements for all parties involved, and meeting others that were connected to my job. \\n\\nMy skills are centered around data-driven analysis and development, though I have been creating software side-projects for a while now. I\\'ll be happy to review my skills if the opportunity presents itself! \\n\\n\\nIf you could solve any problem that impacts your daily life, what would it be and how would you solve it?\\nIf I could solve any problem that presents itself in my daily life, it would be the mundane problems I run into. For example, one of my planned side projects is to set up an automated cat feeder, and another project is to set up software to listen to podcasts while I call my friends on long drives. \\n\\nI\\'ve scoped out the first project pretty well. Once I have the time, I\\'m ready to implement it using Raspberry Pis. I plan on connecting live cameras and attaching Wifi adapters depending on the specs of the Pi I get. Because of the higher hosting costs for live-streamed video, I\\'m considering setting up a server on my PC and attaching a public IP to it so I can serve content directly from my home. Afterwards, I\\'ll position the camera by the car feeder, attach a few motors to the Raspberry Pi to control the food dispenser, and try to remotely take care of my cats even while I am away. \\n\\nI think an interesting next step would be to remotely activate an automatic litter box cleaner. However, since our litter box is currently manually operated, I am still unfamiliar with how that would work. \\n\\nI think the key to solving this problem, as well as many others, is to do adequate research before starting. It’s a common pitfall to jump into a problem and tunnel into a solution before checking that you are solving the problem you intended to solve.\\n\\nAnother key to solving the problem is an internal sense of personal engagement. I believe this cat-feeding problem is a \"solved problem\" in that other solutions do exist online. However, I want to have the actual experience of solving this problem myself, rather than to only copy off of someone else\\'s solution. \\nOne thing on my resume that I’m not proud of:\\nOne thing that is not on my resume is my community involvement, as I do prioritize sharing my technical skills. However, I believe that sharing this experience will introduce myself better as a person. \\n\\nI was a part of a couple student volunteering groups in the past, and in one experience I raised over $80 soliciting empty alcohol bottles from strangers and rummaging through garbage bins. I think this was a special moment for me, as I was able to get a better feel of the members of my community while feeling a sense of purpose and involvement. I think this trait ties back to the reason why I enjoy talking with people so much. There\\'s a little bit of something to learn from everyone, whether it be a colleague, a business, or a stranger. I would say that this mentality contributes to my speaking ability with others. \\n\\nJane Street Cover Letter\\nHello!\\n\\nI\\'m interested in Jane Street because I believe it will help me grow as a professional. As a computer science and business administration student, I find that there\\'s too many avenues I can invest myself into, and too little time. \\n\\nOne of my budding passions is finance, and I\\'ve tailored my future courseload to be oriented towards a Finance specialization by overloading on university courses. Seeing that Jane Street is heavily involved in finance is a good reason to believe I may develop my passion by completing an internship here. \\n\\nMy most recent job was at Sun Life Financial, where I worked as a Data Engineer. I\\'ve also worked in positions of Data Science and Software Development. While my experiences may be diverse, this is because I wish to explore the boundaries of my interests and competencies before I pursue a job I\\'ll be satisfied with for the rest of my immediate career. I encourage you to give my resume a read, and I\\'ll attach my most recent transcripts and work term reports in the URL below if that helps :)\\n\\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vxcdPc_cPkP-4-1-_omGXSOzFqbM7T-s?usp=sharing\\n\\nBest,\\nAnthony \\n\\nNotion writeup\\nHello!\\n\\nI want to work at Notion because Notion\\'s products fascinate me. Since I was introduced to Notion in my first year of university, I quickly grew to like it and I\\'ve been using it ever since. As I prepare for finals, I continue to track my review notes for classes on Notion. \\n\\nWhat has impressed me is the versatility of Notion notes. Whether it\\'s my friends\\' beautifully designed notes, or my functionality-focused \"toggle\" notes, there seems to be a right fit for anyone. Considering that everyone has different preferences when it comes to taking notes, I think it\\'s impressive how Notion has designed a suite of templates and functionalities that enables better productivity out of those who use it. \\n\\nI\\'d love to work for a company whose product I\\'ve personally engaged with to such an extent, and I\\'d be delighted to help Notion envision its next set of features in store.\\n\\nBest,\\nAnthony \\n\\n\\nGecko\\nGecko is my top choice for my final internship of university. I\\'ve heard stories of the company\\'s culture from my friends who have worked and are working at Gecko, and I\\'d be happy to live up to the long hours and dedication of a blooming startup. \\n\\nIntrinsically, I see Gecko as a place that aligns with my present and future skillset. As I plan on completing a Master\\'s in the future, I\\'d hope to contribute to Gecko whether it be through my abilities in software or AI. \\n\\nFeel free to read through my resume and my additional cover letter. I\\'d be happy to get to know the people at Gecko.\\n\\nBest, \\nAnthony\\n\\nProudest accomplishment:\\nMy proudest accomplishment is a mobile app I made to share with my girlfriend. While it started as a secret page on my website, I\\'ve been adding more and more features to it while incorporating more and more technologies. My latest app is my proudest, which is a tracker app built on websockets that her and I now use daily. \\n\\nAbove making a functional, cool app, I love to see the impact that an app makes on others.'),\n",

(we want our new entertainment brand image to be unified)\\nImprove employee satisfaction and productivity while fostering innovation\\nTo sustain and grow our current market share while maintaining the organizational capability to satisfy existing customers, we must structure an effective diversification strategy that keeps our brand globally integrated, ensuring our new entertainment brand image is unified. Additionally, improving employee satisfaction and productivity while fostering innovation is crucial to retaining talent and reducing employee turnover. By focusing on these areas, we can enhance our market position, create a cohesive global brand, and build a motivated and stable workforce.\\n  \\n\\n\\nAlternatives:\\n \\n(good) implementing more horizontal teams continue diversification efforts\\n(good) implementing more of a hybrid model rather than holacratic to shift towards a mature business mindset. \\n\\nAnother possible alternative is via the restructuring towards a greater horizontal structure. As Netflix’s culture had traces of a holacratic structure in the past, moving towards a horizontal structure would enable a greater level of direction for the company. This boost in direction is crucial for Netflix’s expansion efforts deeper into the entertainment industry. It could also enhance employee morale and company culture, as horizontally structured teams may lead to greater employee involvement, which is correlated with a greater sense of responsibility and employee satisfaction. However, possible downsides of a horizontal structure relate to its scalability. It is not feasible for Netflix to become a horizontal company as it has already achieved a level of considerable scale. While a horizontal structure may foster more innovation, the disorganization and reengineering it entails may not be the primary focus of the company as it moves towards a cost-cutting, efficiency focused mindset in a maturing market. \\n\\nIn relation to the decision criteria, this alternative meets the second and third decision criteria. A horizontal structure would allow Netflix to remain adaptive towards the external environment as it diversifies while maintaining employee satisfaction. However, it does not meet the first decision criteria as a horizontal structure may not have the capabilities to sustain the current organizational abilities \\n\\nA better solution uses ideas from the previous horizontal alternative. Drawing from the same benefits as before, this solution would implement a multinational matrix model that contains both horizontal and vertical characteristics. New product lines, including video games and live shows, would be managed horizontally by product line managers. These product line managers would ensure brand integrity over the multinational divisions that Netflix possesses. Vertically, there  are different international managers that would oversee the different entertainment divisions in their country. Though a matrix structure may shift Netflix from a holacratic to a more structured/meeting focused culture, this enables Netflix to better adapt when entering new markets. Organizing departments by geography allows different products to adapt to different regions, while horizontal managers ensure each product remains globally integrated. \\n\\nThis solution addresses many of Netflix’s problems. Though its rapid, tech-based culture was suitable for the company during its stage of growth in the product life cycle, a more bureaucratic strategy is better suited for a company as it enters a stage of maturity. However, as Netflix remains in the film industry where external issues in an unstable environment represent the greatest challenges, an adaptability culture can be well applied to a matrix-like structure. In addition, as Netflix is facing efficiency related problems where few shows become actual hits, an ‘analyzer’ based strategy would allow Netflix to cut costs while researching deeper into what different audience demographics would be interested in. \\n\\nThis solution satisfies all 3 decision criteria. An international matrix strategy allows Netflix to maintain part of its existing horizontal based culture while adding careful restrictions as it expands its new product offerings worldwide. The structure is compatible with both cultural and strategic values that would allow Netflix to remain integrated while also sustaining employee satisfaction. \\n\\nState decision criteria from analysis. \\nAlternatives:\\nShould not be scarecrow ones. “Let’s think of two stupid ideas so that ours are the real one”\\nMust all address problem / opportunity\\nAlternatives must all be realistic in terms of company and problem they are facing\\n3 criteria minimum, 5 max. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-> should ask kim what the components of a complete solution are. Is there a checklist she wants us to cover when talking about a complete as opposed to an alternate solution?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlternatives:\\nMature as a business shifting from focussing on only efficiency hybrid based system to incorporate both vertical information linkages to maintain their market share, while still being able to innovate and focus on product diversification with cross functional departments. Focus on both making current processes efficient to solidify their market share, and differentiation / innovation rather than just differentiation alone. (Anthony, 300wrds)\\nThe first alternative is for Netflix to balance between the present and the future by supporting their product line diversification while satisfying existing customers’ needs. In this alternative, new teams are formed to separately handle the entertainment, games, and live show aspect of Netflix. As these teams will resemble the existing horizontal teams that Netflix possesses, this change is less intrusive from an organizational perspective. Existing teams are to satisfy their customers while new teams are implementable in a timely manner. \\nThe benefit of creating multiple teams is the ability to adjust to unfamiliar environments. As Netflix has historically focused on licensing and producing television shows, the live shows / game industries are ones that Netflix has less experience navigating. Thus, implementing multiple teams with limited hierarchical communication allows for effective environmental reception as well as strong team cohesion. This allows Netflix teams to capture the latest environmental changes, such as cultural trends, then act responsively on these factors to best develop and diversify their product offering. The result of this structure is an improvement to employee satisfaction and innovation, as employees will feel a greater sense of belonging to their team while being free from the bureaucracy that may constrain their ideas. \\nThe next aspect of this alternative are the vertical components of Netflix’s proposed hybrid structure, which acts to unify Netflix as a brand. As Netflix must redefine its brand image as an American TV show provider to a global entertainment company, an exclusive marketing division is suitable for Netflix. This top-level division ensures that marketing functions across teams are aligned in promoting Netflix as a changed company. Though teams are allowed to adjust their promotion towards their product and geographic market, a top-level division allows Netflix’s overarching goal to propagate clearly. \\n\\nGlobal functioning and learning - transnational (200 wrds)\\nIdeally perfect. But we don’t have the setup for it right now. \\nMost of our business is concentrated within america right now. We are exporters of culture. In the future, we want to become streaming for everyone. We can acquire more streaming services and become more transnational. \\nCreate more originals \\nThe second alternative positions Netflix as one of the global dominant streaming services for performance, learning, and diversification. It anticipates high volumes of global demand while facing shifting consumer perceptions. In this alternative, Netflix adopts a transnational business structure. While heading globally decentralized operations in different locations around the world, Netflix relies on innovations collected from its global divisions to innovate and remain competitive. Regionally, Netflix divisions act with autonomy but retain their existing horizontal structure to remain responsive with the environment. In this structure, the organization is tied by shared central values.\\nHowever, certain factors limit the feasibility of the alternative. At the present, though Netflix possesses a degree of structure for their international divisions, they remain strongly dependent on their centralized American team, media production, and audience. This suggests that Netflix performs better as a centralized organization. Though this structure is capable of adding new product lines, there will be challenges in unifying these new products as operations are largely decentralized. This suggests Netflix will have more difficulty in redefining itself as an entertainment company that sells more than shows. \\n\\nCost competing (200 wrds)\\nOptimizing costs\\n\\n2. Optimize costs and stay in streaming market while competing on cost leadership. Focus on optimizing current product and infrastructure to sustain market share and position as the premier streaming service provider. \\n3. One of our recommendations for Netflix to maintain their competitive edge and foster long-term growth is to implement a vertical structure focused on cost leadership. By consolidating control, Netflix can streamline operations and enhance efficiency. This involves integrating all stages of the business under a unified management framework. Such centralization could improve coordination, reduce redundancies, lower operational costs, and speed up decision-making processes.\\nOptimizing the current product and infrastructure is crucial as Netflix matures. Efficient resource allocation reduces waste and directs investments into areas driving customer satisfaction and business growth. A cost leadership strategy also enables Netflix to offer high-quality content at competitive prices, attracting and retaining a large subscriber base.\\nHowever, potential downsides exist. Centralizing control might lead to a less flexible and slower-moving organization. This rigidity could make it harder for Netflix to adapt to changing market conditions or inhibit innovation. Additionally, focusing heavily on cost reduction might compromise content quality, diminishing the viewer\\'s experience. Balancing cost leadership with agility and high-quality content is crucial to avoid these pitfalls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrently Netflix has a very efficiency based model \\nThat \\nLive shows, games, shows\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nWe recommend that Netflix follow alternative #1. Focussing on maturing as a business by transitioning from a focus solely on efficiency to a system that balances both efficiency and innovation. By implementing more information flow throughout the organization and fostering innovation internally across different departments horizontally. We believe that this approach will allow Netflix to sustain it’s current market share, differentiate it’s product offerings, and optimize it’s current products while still driving growth.\\nImplementation Plan\\nPhase 1: Enhancing the structure of the Organization (6 Months)\\nInternal Organizational Audit\\nWho: Company C-Suite Executives, Vice Presidents, and Senior Management\\nWhat: Conduct an audit of all internal organizational processes, and setup benchmarks / metrics for monitoring performance of new organizational processes in progress.\\nWhen: Implementation during Months 1-2.\\nWhere: Audit will occur at all Netflix offices globally, monitoring each individual office.\\nHow: Outsource the audit to a consulting firm with further organizational expertise, and have executives, vice presidents, and senior management work in conjunction to identify organizational deficiencies, and setup benchmarks for how to evaluate the proposed organizational improvements.\\nImportant metrics to look at:\\nMarket Share, Employee Turnover, Employee Satisfaction, Customer Satisfaction.\\nImplementing better communication flows vertically from management to lower level staff\\nWho: Chief Operating Officer (COO) - Netflix currently lacks a COO, implementing this hire will enable a focus on internal operations within the organization.

After exams had ended, I left for Taiwan. In the meantime, I’ve been spending time with my family and making sure I’m nice and destressed before the next term starts.\\n\\nAnyway, here’s the long-awaited life update:\\n\\nAfter Dec. 2023, I spent the next 4 months at Sun Life. I’m sure you know of it, as we met a few times after that. I still keep the Huawei stuffed doll and our 2023 TRC Banquet photos in my room! It’s a reminder of the good times I spent with you, Cherry, and Ryan. \\n\\nSpeaking of Cherry and Ryan, I suppose you might be curious what became of them:\\nFor Ryan, he’s headed to John’s Hopkin’s University to study biomedical engineering. He’s a pretty smart kid! He’s also dating Cherry.\\nFor Cherry, she’s headed to Georgia Tech University to study (I think) mechanical engineering. She is still as friendly as you may remember. \\nThe three of us still keep in contact. The night before they left for America to begin their newest term as Masters students, I helped them pack up their belongings. \\n\\nAs for me, as you might have heard, I also started dating someone I had met at Huawei (she worked at Allstate, so you wouldn’t have known her). I’d like to credit the relationship advice I received from you, as well as the boost in confidence you gave me about my voice . Though she and I have only recently begun seeing each other, I look forward to what we could be in the future.\\n\\nSchoolwise, I recently took operating systems (OS) and algorithms as my 2 CS courses, along with several other Business courses. I think OS was quite an interesting course once I had gotten past the struggles of understanding the professor’s slides. Algorithms was useful enough, as knowing more algorithms will never harm me in future interviews. \\n\\nAs for next term, I think I will try to improve my ML skills! I’m considering something related to computer vision with the extra freedom of choice I have in my undergrad (though unfortunately, not time freedom ).\\n\\nAs for me, I’ve been working on small projects here and there. Feel free to make an account on my blog at https://ant52ho.github.io/#/blog, or just sift through the posts if you’re bored. It was a fun little project I made to express myself.  \\n\\nHow have you been doing lately? How has the networking team has done since I left Huawei?

Once a program is loaded, all references are adjusted by a constant value. \\nNot good because there can be shared memory, and requires a contiguous region of memory. \\nIe the references to memory in a program in address space need a constant added to them. \\n\\nDynamic relocation: Base / bound registers:\\nBase: physical address = virtual address + base\\nBound: virtual addr + base < bound. \\nContext switch must reload base and bound. \\nPros: Inexpensive. \\nCons: can’t share code. Growing process is impossible. \\n\\nMMU (memory management unit)\\nTranslates virtual to physical addresses. \\nFor base/bound, would store 2 values: base and bound. Context switches would change these values. \\n\\nSegmented addresses:\\nIe multiple base/bound registers. Ie text, data, stack. \\nAddress space is built from many segments.\\nVirtual address is divided into segment number an d offset.  \\nDiff segments could have different protections\\n\\t\\nIe we have 3 segments. Maybe for text, data, stack. Some can be written to, some can’t be. This is determined by the segment table, which states base/bound for each segment. The Virt address maps each segment to the base address. \\nThis segment number is 2 bit (because it goes from 0-3). Its offset is 12 bit. Because each address is in hex, hex is 16. So 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. \\nPros; can allow sharing as segments can point to same locations in memory. \\nDisadvantage: requires address translation hardware, which limits performance. Requires contiguous blocks of memory. Ie n byte segment needs n contiguous bytes of physical memory. \\n\\nFragmentation:\\nPaging does not have external fragmentation as all pages are the same size. External is when memory gets freed and partly filled by reqs for smaller pieces\\nInternal fragmentation is when the page itself is not completely filled. \\n\\nPaging:\\nDivide virtual and phys memory into small fixed sized slices. \\nPage table: maps virtual page number to physical page number. \\nPage table also stores whether something is valid, or protection. \\nGiving types to pages allows it to trap the kernel on write. \\nEach process has its own page table. On a context switch, these tables need to be swapped. Virtual pages are mapped to physical pages using the page table. \\n\\nVirtual addr translation notes:\\nSize of physical addr tells you the size of physical memory. \\n\\nPage tables:\\nEach process has its own page table. \\nPage table maps pages to frames (they have the same size)\\nEach row of page table is called page table entry. \\n\\nValid bit: \\nIndicates if the PTE is used or not.\\nHow does this affect context switches and page replacements? \\n\\nAddress translation in MMU\\nMMU uses page table base register - points to the page table for the current process. \\nIe on context switch the MMU changes the page table base register. \\nTo translate a virtual address from the MMU:\\nGet page number by dividing virtual address by page size. \\nGet offset from virtual address mod page size. \\nUsing page number, look up PTE. \\nIf the PTE is not valid, raise an exception. Otherwise, combine corresponding frame number (from PTE) with offset to determine physical address.\\nNote that in a page table, valid pages are contiguous and come first. As the process uses more physical memory, more pages are used. \\n\\ni e notice how these tables end in 0s and not valid. This is because the process does not need that memory yet. \\nPTEs also contain write protection vit, and reference + dirty bit. \\n\\nAlso note:\\nIn modern, 64 bit architectures, Virtual addresses are 48 bits. \\nIf vmem is 2^48 bytes, and a page size is 4kb or 2^12 bytes, then there can be 2^36 pages. If each PTE is 4bytes (32 bits), then there can be 2^8 = 256GB of single level page table. \\n\\nMulti level paging:\\nBecause pgae tables can get up to 256GB in modern day x64, we want to have PTs that point to PTs. Ie split page table into multiple levels. \\n\\nGoal of multi level page - reduce level of individual page tables. \\n\\n\\nTLB: (translation lookside buffer)\\nA cache for page table entries\\nApplicable because the page table entries may take several memory accesses to access, especially if there is multi-level paging. \\nCan be hardware or software managed. \\nHardware:\\nTLB check if it’s there. If not, needs to evict an entry and load in the correct one. \\nReloads TLB with pages from page tables. \\nRequires complex hardware. \\nSoftware:\\nRaise exception if not in TLB. \\nSimpler hardware\\nRequires optimized software and fast exception handling. \\n\\nWhat to find in certain TLBs:\\nVirtual page number, pid, page frame, flags. \\nFlags include no cache, writable, valid, global. \\n\\nTLB PID and global bit:\\nDiff procs have diff translations for same virtual address. \\nWe don’t need to flush the TLB on context switch. \\nOnly flush TLB entries when reusing a PID. \\nGLobal bit is used for pages shared across all address spaces. Must make sure the TLB ignores the PID field. \\nIn most hardware a TLB flush does not flush global pages. \\n\\nHardware lookup algo:\\nMSB is 1: not in bounds bc kernel addr. \\nNo Virtual page number match? -> translation not in TLB. TLB miss exception\\nPID mismatches and global bit not set? -> TLB miss exception\\nValid bit not set? - TLB miss exception .\\nWrite to read-only page -> TLB modification exception. \\n\\nMaking paging fast:\\nX64 has 4 mem reads. \\nLook for page table addr in for levels, look up physical page number in page table, access the physical page. \\n\\nWhere does kernel live?\\nIn x64, first 48 bits are user space, next 16 are for kernel. \\n\\nPaging in day-to-day use:\\nDemand paging - load paeeges if they are needed. \\nCopy-on-write: only copy over a page (ie use reference) until a modification is made, where then a copy will be used instead. \\n\\nExploiting secondary storage:\\nWe want to use less available main memory, while being able to have virtual address space be larger than physical address space\\nCan do this my letting pages from virtual memory be stored in secondary storage, and swapping pages between secondary storage and main memory so that they are in main memory when needed. \\nResident set: set of virtual pages present in memory. Changes as pages are swapped in and out of physical memory. \\nPresent bit: tracks which pages are in physical memory. \\nWhen a process tries to access a pg. Not in memory, ie present bit is 0, \\nHardware: exception that kernel must handle\\nSoftware: kernel detects after TLB miss from page’s PTE. \\nAttempting to access a non-resident page => page fault. \\n\\nPage fault:\\nSwaps page from secondary storage (while possibly evicting another page)\\n\\nMemory hierarchy:\\n100 nano seconds for ram, 15000 naniseconds for SSD, 15000000 for HDD/\\nREplacement polify is needed\\nReplacement policy \\n\\nSteps in handling a page fault:\\nReference in TLB, \\nException leads to trap. \\nOS handles the call. Page is on backing store. \\nBring in the missing page into  afree frame. \\nReset page table.  (because being brought into memory is doesn’t mean page table isupdated)\\nRestart instruction. \\n\\nWorking set model:\\n20%of memory gets 80% of memory accesses. So we keep 20% in memory, 80% in disc. \\n\\nIdempotent instruction:\\nCan be repeated many times without mutating. Ie mutable. \\n\\nSuperpages:\\nTwo level TLBs \\n\\n\\nPage buffering:\\nKeep pool of free frams. \\nOn page fault. Select page to evict, store page fetched from swap space int o already free physical page from pool. \\nOnce victim page is stored, add its page frame to the free pool. (it should be clean at this point)\\nIf page fault is for a page still in the free pool, then reuse it. \\n\\nThrashing: \\nSwapping pages in and out. Happens when processes require more memory than system has. \\nSecondary storage will be close to 100% utilization, but system will not make much progress. \\n\\nReasons for thrashing:\\nNo 80/20 rule, hot memory doesn’t fit in physical memory, process memory fits individually but there are too many. \\n\\nPage allocation:\\nGlobal allocation policy: any page from any process can be removed. Evict least recently used page of any process. \\nLocal allocation policy: \\nisolate processes by determining how much memory they should have,\\nUse page fault frequency to determine how much mem a process should have. \\nPFF = num page fault / number of instructions executed. \\nAllocate more if of above threshold. Allocate less if below. \\nPFF can change throughout phases of a program. \\nuse separate policy to determine which pages to evict withi each process. \\n\\nPage allocation - eviction policies:\\nFIFO: evcit oldest\\nAdding more physical memory doesn’t always mean fewer page faults, but generally it does. \\nOptimal: theoretical\\nLRU yes. \\nClock algo:\\nDo FIFO but skil accessed pages. \\nIe if “Access” bit = 1, set to 0 and skip. Else: evict\\n One hard is worse for larger memory. Most pages references in long interval. \\n\\nAdd second clock hand.Leading hand clears accessed bits.  Trailing hand evicts pages when A = 0\\nAlso wants to evict clean pages before dirty pages because no writebacl. \\n\\n\\nFile and file systems\\nData structures and algorithms for file storage, retrieval, access. \\nLogical file system: what programmer sees\\nVirtual file system - presents multiple file systems to users under one abstraction\\nPhysical file system - how files are stored in physical media. \\n\\nCommon file operations:\\nOpen: returns a file descriptor. File descriptors are required as param to identify file. \\nClose: invalidates a valid file descriptor\\nRead, write, seek: \\nRead - copies data from file into virtual address space\\nWrite - copies data from virtual address space into a file\\nSeek - enables non sequential reading / writing. \\n\\nFile position and seeks:\\nEach file descriptor has an associated file position\\nRead / write start from cur file posn and update cur file posn as bytes are read / written. \\nSeek - used for non-sequential file I/O. Next r/w will do it from that posn. \\n\\nDirectories and inumbers\\nDirectories map file names to inumbers\\nInumber is a unique identifier for a file or directory. \\nGiven a i number, file syste mcan find data and meta data for file. \\nIe inumber is a number that identifies a file and its data + meta data’]\\nDirectories provide a way to group related files. \\nFile system can be viewed as a tree with a single root directory. \\n\\nPathnames:\\nFile names may also be identified by pathnames. Directories also have pathnames. \\n\\nLinks:\\nHard link - association between a name and an inumber. \\nWhen a file is created, a hard link to that file is also created. \\nAdditional hard links can be made from hard links. \\nLinking to an existing file creates a new pathname for the file\\nEach file has a unique inumber, but may have multiple path names. \\nIt is not possible to link to a directory. \\nHard links can also be removed. \\nFile system ensures that if link exists, file that it refers to also exists. \\nKernel keeps track of how many hard links there are to a file. When the last link is removed, a file is deleted. \\nWhen there are no more links to a file, it has no pathname and can no longer be opened. \\n\\nSymlink:\\nSymbolic link, or soft link\\nAssociation between file name and pathname. \\nReferential integrity (ie checking if the actual file exists) does not exist for symlinks. \\nIe org file is deleted and replaced (ie with possible diff inode), this symlink would still work. It is just like a pointer. \\n\\nMultiple file systems:\\nCan have mult systems when you ie plug flash drive usb into laptop. \\nMounting does not combine the two file systems into one file system - creates single namespace that combines the namespaces of two file systems. Namespace is temporary. \\nIe in windows mounting a USB assigns it a random letter. \\n\\nLinux style mount where you can specify a directory to mount a new file system. \\n\\nFile system impl key questions:\\nWhat data needs to be stored persistently?\\nFile data, file meta-data (owner, creation date), file system metadata (access  time), directories and links)\\nWhat data needs to be stored non-persistently? \\nFile descriptor, file position for each open file, open file table, cached copies of persistent data. \\n\\nRam is byte addressable\\nDrives are sector addressable \\n\\nVery small file system terms:\\nSector: units of the drive that can be addressable. \\nSectors > bytes. \\nBlock: composed of multiple sectors. \\nIe you can have 8 sectors into a 4KB block. \\nYou want to determine how much meta data to store. \\nNote that here we are thinking of a way to store persistent data. \\nYou want to partition a part of your drive to metadata, and the rest of your drive to actual data. \\nYou need a way to map files to their data blocks. \\nCan do this my creating an array of inodes, where each inode contains the meta data for the file.  (inodes contain metadata)\\nThe index into the inode array is the file’s index number (inumber). \\nFor example, to find a file, you check the inode array for the index, which pulls up the metadata\\nYou can choose to allocate a certain amount of data for each inode, and also dedicate a certain number of blocks for inodes. (ie blocks that store inodes that store meta data)\\nWE need a way to track which inodes and datablocks are in use. \\nCan use a bitmap for this. \\nIe dedicate a block to track inodes in use\\nIe dedicate a block to track data blocks in use. \\nA 4kb block would be able to track 32kb of inodes as we only need a single bit to rep a single inode. \\nWe also wan tto store metainformation about the whole file system in the first block, called the superblock. \\nSuperblock contains info like how many inodes and blocks are in the system, location ofinode bitmap, data map bitmap, location of inode table, etc. \\n\\nIn summary: superblock stores file system meta info like where to find the bitmaps, location of inode table. I bmap stores which inodes are in use. Dbmap stores which data blocks are in use. Rest iblocks store the inode metadata. \\n\\n\\nInode:\\nFixed size index structure\\nHolds file meta data and pointers to the data blocks. \\nMeta data includes:\\nFile type, file permissions, file length, time of last access, last file update, last inode update, number of hard links to the file, pointers to data blocks. \\nHow can an inode point to all data blocks for the file, even for very large files? (considering that its size is fixed) \\nUse indirect data pointers!\\n\\nIn our inode system, we could have 12 direct pointers to data blocks, and an indirect pointer that points to a block full of direct pointers. \\nIe if blocks were 4kb large, and pointers were 4byte (32 bit) addresses, then 12 direct pointers and 1 indirect pointer could store  (12 + 1024) * 4kb max file size. \\nIf we need more space, just use double indirect pointer. \\n\\nDirectories:\\nImplemented as a file that contains directory entires, pairing up inumber and file name.\\n\\nDirectory files are only updated by the kernel in response to file system ops such as create link, create file. \\n\\n\\nIn memory structures:\\nFor each process there’s a descriptor table: \\nTable for file descriptors (per process). \\nTracks:\\nWhich file descriptors does the proc have open, to which file does each open descriptor refer,  what is the current file positon for each descriptor? \\nSystem wide kernel maintains\\nOpen file table - files currently in use by any process\\nInode cache - inmemory copies of recently used inodes\\nBlock cache - in memory copies of data blocks and indirect blocks. \\n\\nReading a file:\\nRead inode, check permissions, store file descriptor in file desc table and add file to open file table.\\nAfter we read the data blocks one by one from the file. After each block read, the file’s inode is reupdated to change the access time for strictly the file. \\n\\nCreating a file:\\nNavigate to dir, check that dir doesn’t already have file, read/write the inode bitmap to find and allocate the new inode for file, create the new file in the target directory by writing into its data, write init unto new inode, update par inode last mod, for each block, read into inode to track data output location, r/w to bitmap data to find block, \\n\\n\\nHow to track file’s data:\\nMust map the data blocks stored in inodes to secondary storage locations. \\nMost files are small, but much of the disk is allocated to large files. Many io ops are made to large files. This means we want good sequential and good random access. \\nDifferent file storage types:\\nExtent based: ie specify all space then allocate. However, this leads to external fragmentation\\nLinked files: linked list of data blocks. However, not good random access. Poor non-contiguous block access time. \\nLinked blocks in file allocation table (FAT): Still has pointer chasing, but can cache file allocation table so it is faster. Ie we move the block links into the cache rather than in the blocks themselves. USBs use this version. \\nCan protect against errors by storing duplicate copies of the FAT on disc. \\nIndexed files: file has an array holding all its block pointers. -> easy sequential and random access, but needs large contiguous block. Smaller blocks have much internal fragmentation. \\n\\nHistory of directories:\\nSingle dir -> allunique names. \\n1 dur per user\\nHierarchical name spaces. Ie dir to dir. Or dir to file .\\nDirectories are saved like reg. Files. \\n\\nCwd:\\nKeep a default list of active contexts -> search path. Ie check for executable sectors, env. \\n\\nCrash recovery (fucked):\\nFscheck checks file system after crash. (fsck)\\nFile system information is usually inaccurate right after a crash\\nscan check free block map, block/inode counds\\nSystem may have corrupt inodes. \\nIe bad block numbers, block used in more than one place. \\nFields in inodes could be wrong\\nCount number of directory entries to it in the entire fs to verify link count. If no entries but count ~= 0, move to lost and found\\nMake sure file size and used data counts match blocks\\nDirectories may be bad\\nFile names unique, all directories reachable, holes not allowed (ie must be able to .. and .)\\nEnsure that fsck can recover it\\nIe if data was written async, any subset of data structures may have been updated before a crash\\n\\nHow can cross allocation happen?:\\nDelete file, append to other file, crash. \\nThe new file can use the old file block, while old inode might not be updated. Cross allocation occurs because block is used by both files. Often older modified time is wrong, but can’tbe sure\\nAppend to one file, allocate indirect block, crash\\nInode points to indirect block, but indirect block could contain garbage. \\n\\nSolutions:\\nOs must update fs in consistent order. \\nWrite new inode to disk before creating directory entry. \\nRemove directory name before deallocating inode\\nWrite cleared inode to disk before updating free map. (this prevents scenario 1 where two files use the same inode, as free map determines allocation\\nMake metadata updates synchronous: \\n\\nCrash recovery performance vs consistency:\\nCrash recoverability comes at a cost. \\nIe metadata updates must be synchronous, so you can’t write two updates to the same block at the same time. \\nTasks can be 10-20x slower. \\nOne solution could be a battery backed ram, which is alive even when the system crashes. \\nExpensive, don’t learn battery died until too late, and if it’s an OS bug then ram being fine doesn’t matter. \\nOther solu; uninterruptable power supply. \\nCan also do advanced file system techniques\\n\\n3 rules in ordering updates:\\nNever write pointer before init structure it points to. (make sure structure exists before pointer)\\nNever reuse resource before nullifying all pointers to it. (don’t delete until all pointers are gone)\\nNever clear last pointer to live resource before setting new one. (never have a live resource lack pointers)\\n\\nCan achieve this by keeping a list on what happened to the updates in the buffer. \\n\\nPointer: directory. Data -> the struct. \\nIf the directory is found in block X and the data is found in block Y, then we say that X -> Y, or x depends on y. \\n\\nCyclic dependency: \\nOccurs when updating the same directory block and inode block simultaneously. \\nIe you (proc A create) can’t init directory until inode init in block, but you also (proc b delete) can’t delete inode block until directory is cleared. \\nCrash might occur between ordered but related writes. \\n\\nSoft updates:\\nSolu to cyclical dependencies\\nWrite blocks in any other, but keep track of dependencies. \\nWhen writing a block, roll back any changes you cannot yet commit to disk (ie don’t do them)\\nThis effectively prioritizes later updates I think? \\nIe you change the file system view on memory. But now you want to write it back to disk. Memory view shows a cyclical dependency. We iterate down the changes. Any change that depends on another is temporarily  rolled back. . \\n\\nStructure for updated field or pointer contains new val, old val, list of updates on which update depends on. \\nSystem can write back blocks in any order, but must temp undo updates with pending dependencies. \\nSome dependencies are better handled by postponing rather than rolling-back updates. \\n\\nFsck  - foreground and background parts\\n\\nJournalling\\nMost problematic writes are to metadata\\nCan use a write ahead log to journal the metadata. \\nFirst write to log, then write to disk. \\nCan group multiple entries into one log entry. \\nEx delete dir\\nRecord all freed blocks and changed directory entries in log, return control to user, write out changed directories, bitmaps in background. \\nChallenge: must find oldest relevant log entry. \\nCan use checkpoints - ie each time we stably commit something, we record the log value checkpoint. \\n\\nMemory and IO buses\\nBus: communication between various devices in a computer\\nInternal bus: communication between processor and RAM\\nPeripheral bus: allows devices in the computer to communicate. \\n\\nCommunication between devices:\\nCommunication is done through device registers. \\nTypes: \\nStatus: for read purposes. See device state\\nCommand: can write here. \\nData: used to transfer blocks of data to/from device. \\nThere can be status and command register. \\nDevices work by writing / reading values form offsets. \\nIn a serial console, writeIRQ, or write interrupt request lets you know when a write request has completed. \\n\\nDevice drivers:\\nPart of the kernel that interacts with a device. \\nCommunication happsn by reading from or writing to the command, status, and data registers. \\nCan interact with device through polling and interrupts:\\nPolling:\\nDriver repeatedly checks the device status, which uses processor time\\nInterrupts:\\nKernel does not wait for device to complete the command. Instead, request completion is taken care of by the interrupt handler. \\nIe device updates status register then generates an interrupt. \\n\\nHow does device driver access device registers/\\nDevice is assigned ports or device is assigned physical memory. \\nPort mapped i/o\\nAssigned port numbers which correspond to regions of memory ina smaller address space. \\nMemory mapped i/o\\nIe each register has a physical memory address. \\n\\nLarger data blocks can be transferred via:\\nProgrammed controlled i/o - driver moves data between memory and a buffer on the device\\nProcessor is used to transfer the data\\nDirect memory access: \\nDevice transfers the data to/from memory. \\nProcessor is not used to transfer the data. \\n\\nSummary: \\nDevices are controlled by registers. You have to write to a certain offset to read these registers. They have status, command, and data registers. \\nTo check these register values, you can use polling or interrupts \\nTo modify these register values, you can use port mapped io or memory mapped io\\nTo export data from these devices you can use DMA or program controlled io. \\nDevice registers can be accessed by: \\nUsing port mapped input output. Meaning certain ports on the device are accessed by the driver\\nUsing memory mapped i/o. Meaning each register has a physical memory address.  \\nData can be transferred to/from devices by:\\nDirect memory access: device has access to memory\\nProgrammed controlled i/o: driver moves data between memory and a device buffer. \\n\\nHard drives:\\nPlatters and actuator arm. \\nPlatter is a stack of discs. Arm reads both sides of disc. \\nPlatters are organized into tracks. Both sides of the platter are used to store data. \\nRead.write heads sense or record data along one cylinder/track at a time. \\nIn order discs, each block is specified by cylinder/track, head/surface, and sector. \\nThis is called the cylinder, head, sector method. \\nIe give me side, distance, sector and I can locate a piece of data. \\nIn newer disks we follow logical block addressing where inner tracks/cylinedrs have less blocks, and adjacent blocks in different cylinders are not adjacent to each other. \\nThis is called zoning (larger blocks on outer cylinders), track skewing (improve sequential access by changing sector 0 position across cylinders), and sparing (flaws blocks mapped to new locations)\\n\\nSeek time - time it takes to move the arm to the correct track/cylinder. \\n\\nSeek:\\nSpeedup - accelerate arm to max speed or halfway point\\nCoast - at max speed for long seeks. \\nSlowdown - stop arm near destination\\nSettle - adjust head to actual desired cylinder / track. \\n\\nRequest service time:\\nSeek time + rotational latency + transfer time\\nIe time it takes to reach cylinder + time it takes to reach block + time it takes for desired block to pass until the head. \\nNote: we don’t know the location of the head so everything is averaged. \\n\\nMax latency = time for one revolution = 60 * 1 / rotations per minute\\n\\nAverage seek time = max seek time / 3\\n\\nAverage rotational latency = time for 1 rotation /2\\n\\nTime to transfer 1 sector = max latency / numsectors per track\\n\\nExpected time to read 10 sectors = avg seek time + avg rotational latency + read time = /3 + /2 + 10 * time to transfer 1 sector\\n\\nDisk interface:\\nDisk controller controls access to the disc. You can queue commands (up to 32 requests, makes it so it intelligently schedules reads based on cur read/write head pos),\\ndisc cache is used for read ahead, ie cache read data into disk so we don’t have to incur a whole rotation before we begin the read\\nWrite cache - data may crash. \\n\\n\\nDisk scheduling:\\nRememeber that we can buffer up to 32 requests. \\nScheduler orders requests to minimize seek (track switching) times. \\nMult algorithms exist to schedule\\nFirst come first served:\\nProcess in order requests are received\\nPros: easy\\nCons: does not exploit request locality. Has increased avg latency. \\nShortest positioning time first\\nPick request with shortest seek time. \\nPros: exploits locality of disk requests to reduce seek time\\nCons: starvation - block that is far away might never get processed. \\nImprovement would prioritize requests that are older. \\nElevator scheduling (SCAN):\\nLike shortest positioning time, but must always scan in same direction\\nPros: locality of requests, resolves starvation\\nCons: Tracks in middle get better service because they are serviced in both directions. \\nCSCAN: sweep in one direction then return to beginning again. \\n\\n\\nFlash drives: \\nCircuits rather than spinning disc. \\nDRAM requires constant power. But flash memory does not via properties of electrons. \\nBits = 1 -> unwritten. It pages are init. To 1. \\nFlash mem is divided into blocks, which are divided into pages. \\nRead/write occurs by page level (small). Overwriting and deleting occur at block level (larger)\\nOverwriting and deleting requires a high voltage to switch 0s to 1s, which can only be applied at the block level. \\n\\nWriting and deleting from flash memory:\\nNaive: read into ram, reinit by set bits back to 1, Update in ram and write back to ssd\\nFaster: deleted pg is marked as invalid, write to unused page, update translation table, needs garbage collection ie reclaiming pages (by writing them back to 1)\\nLimitations:\\nBlocks have a limited number of waer cycles. Ie physically they wear down. So SSD controllers perform wear levelling, which distributes writes evenly across blocks so that the bloks wear down at an even rate. \\n\\nThere are 4 types of flash memory. 2, 4, 8, 16 levels. More levels = cheaper cost per GB (to manufacture), but slower to access data and wears out sooner. \\n\\n\\nThread scheduling:\\nMeasured in 2 ways:; response time and turnaround time\\nResponse: how long it takes from arrival of job until it starts running\\nIe when is it first served\\nTurnaround: arrival until it finishes running\\nIe when does it finish serving (because it can get premepted) \\n\\nAlgos\\nFirst come first serve:\\nSimple, avoids starvation. Can use pre emptive variant of round-robin scheduling. \\nShortest job first: \\nMinimizes average turnaround time. \\nLong jobs may starve\\nPre emptive variant: shortest remain gtime first. \\n\\nProcessor scheduling vs thread scheduling:\\nJobs to be scheduled are the threads, in processor scheduling. \\nRuntimes of threads are usually not known. They might also be blocked, or have different priorities. \\n\\nShould consider responsiveness (start time), fairness (no starvation), efficiency (switching costs)\\n\\nProcessors should consider process and thread priorities. \\nTwo approaches:\\nSchedule greatest prio (MLFQ)\\nWeighted fair sharing (CFS)\\nGive thread share of processor in relation to its priority. \\n\\n\\nMulti level feedback queue ->  most common scheduling algo:\\nHigher level = higher priority = smaller quantum. \\nPreempted threads are put in back of next lower-priotiy. \\nWhen thread wakes up after blocking, put into highest level prio. \\nInteractive threads stay in high prio queues. \\nScheduler selects lower level threads only if higher level is empty. \\n\\nStarvation is prevented by periodically placing all threads in the highest priority queue (ie in case there keeps on being threads in the highest level queue)\\n\\nLinux completely fair scheduler (CFS):\\nLinux uses diff scheduler for the shits\\nEach thread gets a share of the processor proportional to its weight. \\nIe weight 1 should run 1s, weight 4 should run 4s. (or have that proportion)\\n\\nThread with smallest runtime to weight ratio should run next and run more to increase share of processor time. \\n\\nTo implement, track virtual run time of each runnable thread. \\nVirtual runtime is actual run time adjusted by thread weights. Always run thread with lowest virtual runtime. When thread is runnable, init virtual run time between min and max virtual run time values. \\n\\nVRT advances slowly for threads with high weights, but quickly for theads with low weights. \\nQuantum is the same for all threads and priorities. Ie is only up to which taask you run first. \\nAlways time / weight * total weight. Notice how the units cancel out. \\n\\n\\nScheduling on multicore processors:\\nCan have a per core ready queue or a shared ready queue. \\nAs number of cores grow, contention for ready queue becomes a problem. \\nPer core design scales to large number of cores, as you don’ tneed to share and mutually exclude. \\nAs well, running the same thread on the same core may be faster as the data is cached. This is affinity. \\n\\nLoad balancing: \\nIn per-core designs, queues could have different lengths, which result in a load imbalance. \\nIf speed is goal, per core systems may need a load balancer. \\nIf energy efficiency is goal, then may need to disconnect cores whenthey aren’t in use\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n B * S * T\\nReduce rational latency for requests from disk: increate rotational velocity\\nData transfer time: number of bytes per sector, s, t, or rotational velo\\n\\nExpected time = EX seek time + ex rotational latency + read time\\n\\nEx seek time = max seek time / 3 = 3+ 0.025 * d\\nWhat is d? First, track is over 0th track as 50 sectors per track. And on 20. 512 -> move inwards 10 times. So d is 10. \\nMin d is 10\\nMax d is 2000. \\n\\nNo. 500 sectors per cylinder. Since 50 sectors per track, and there are 10 tracks. So 500 sectors per cylinder. 596 is on second cylinder. \\nRight now head is on cylinder 20. So it needs to move 19 (Sure) times. \\nSo seek time is 3 + 0.025 * 19 = 3.475ms\\nEx rotational latency is max / 2 = 1 / 60 / 2 = 1 / 120\\nMin rotational latency is 0. Max is 1 / 60\\n\\nTransfer time = time it takes to go over block = 60 rotations per second, 1/60 per rotation, 50 sectors per track = 1 / 60 / 50?\\nEx = 3.475 / 1000 +   1 / 120 +  1 / 60 / 50 = 12.14ms\\nMin = 3.475 / 1000 +   0 +  1 / 60 / 50 = 3.8ms\\nMax = 3.475 / 1000 +   1/60 +  1 / 60 / 50 = 20.47ms\\n\\nSCAN, C-SCAN, SSTF\\nSpft, or SSTF: shortest seek time first\\n\\nSCAN - next seek in same dir\\nC-SCAN - circular scan\\n\\nCur: 200\\n400, 20, 19, 74, 899. \\n\\nSSTF - 74 -> 20, 19, 400, 899\\nSCAN -> SAME\\nCSCAN 74 20 19 899 400\\n\\nTime = seek time + rotational latency + read time = 0 + 1/w - d + 1/ws\\n\\nYEs it does. \\nK = d. \\n\\nEST = seek time + rot lat + read time = 5.5 + 1/w/2 + 1/w*1/s \\n\\nDMA: a device has direct read write access to memory.

Kernel makes sure processes can run smoothly, resources can be allocated, programs are isolated from each other. \\nMain problems that kernel solves: accesses, permissions, space allocation, processor allocation, isolating resources\\n\\n\\n\\nKernel vs os: Kernel is part of the OS. \\nKernel responds to system calls, interrupts, and exceptions. \\nOS: contains kernel as well as utility programs, command line, programming libraries. \\n\\nTypes of OS: \\nLibrary OS (runs one program at a time, assumes there are no bad users, very simple)\\nMultitasking OS: multiple processes existing at the same time. When one process blocks, run a nother one. \\nMulti-user OS: has perms implemented. \\n\\nTypes of kernels: \\nMonolithic - entire os is in kernel. Includes, drivers. \\nMicrokernel - kernel is very tiny. Drivers are outside. Only necessary components are there. \\nMicrokernel is slower because almost everything needs to go through a syscall, which is slower. \\nHybrid\\nReal-time\\n\\nKernel of OS: Part of OS that handles system calls, exceptions, and interripts. \\nOS: Includes kernel, but also utility programs, command line programs, and programming libraries that help functions use kernel ie posix. \\n\\nAdv. of allowing simultaneous threads: When first thread is blocked, can work on another thread. Can implement priority between threads. Programs are more responsive (ie less time before program starts)\\n\\nSystem calls:\\nHandled by the kernel. Some functions are passed into the kernel via wrappers in user space\\nKernel space has control over registers, TLB, interact with devices, enable/disable interrupts\\nTo enter kernel space you have to use an interrupt (device generated) or an exception (processor generated)\\nSystem calls are a type of exception. \\n\\nCaller saved - saved by caller. Callee saved - saved by one who gets called. \\n\\nSystem calls:\\nPerformed by T_syscall exception vector. \\nApplication loads syscall registers into appropriate registers \\nLoads syscall number into a special register. \\nExecutes int 60, which generates an interrupt that corresponds to 60: syscall. \\nProcessor looks up interrupt, associates interrupt to an address, jumps to address, and runs syscall. \\nWhen done, processor returns to userspace and user mode. \\n\\nStacks on stacks nasus:\\n\\n\\nStacks: kernel cannot rely on application stacks because it may be full, or be corrupt. \\n\\nTrap frame: \\nInterripts and exceptions are handled using trap frame. Struct that registers are stored in after interrupt or exceptions is called a trap frame. \\n\\nSyscall ex \\nmain() -> printf()\\n\\nTrap common (creates trap frame)\\ntrap_entry() -> determine cause of interrupt. Determines it is a system call. \\nsyscall_entry() -> checks the rdi value -> realizes that it is a write function\\nSycall write()\\nUse write driver  to trigger device\\nPop everything\\n\\nLet’s try syscall again\\n\\nTrap common() -> creates the trapframe\\nTrap entry(0 -> determines cause behind interrupt-> in this case realizes that its a syscall\\nSys_entry -> reads rdi register to findds it is a syscall write\\nsyscall_write() ->prompts driver to write. \\n\\nLets try full syscall execution:\\nThe application stores all appropriate data into registers. \\nThe application stores the type of exception into the rdi register\\nWe execute the interrupt corresponding to syscall. In this case, it’s int 60\\nProcessor handles the interrupt, and sees that int 60 corresponds to a syscall. It jumps to the syscall addr and runs it. \\n\\nThreads:\\nShare code, global vars, heap, file descriptor. \\nDon’t share: stack and register\\n\\nConcurrency - preemptive multitasking, parallelism. \\n\\nPros of threads:\\nLighter weight, responsiveness, priority. \\n\\n\\nContext switch: (needs studying) \\nSwitch from one thread to another. \\nSave program counter and general purpose registers\\nSave floating point registers\\nSave status registers\\n\\nStack for context switch:\\nTrap common (trap frame)\\nTrap entry (determines cause of call, realizes its a timer interrupt)\\nSched schediuler \\nSched switch -> loads in address space\\nSwitch stack -> additional registers that need to be stored\\nSiwtch frame -> one kernel to next.   (just contains callee saved registers) \\n\\n\\nLimitations of mult user threads to one kernel thread:\\nCannot take advantage of mult processor or cores (only):\\nBlocking system call blocks all threads. \\nSolve by replacing blocking system calls with non-blocking. \\nCritical section - access to shared object\\n\\nRace condition - res depends on order of execution\\n\\nCache line - unit of data between core and cache. \\n\\nSeq consistency - as if instructions are executed sequentially. \\nRequires program order on indv processors. \\nWrite atomicity - if any processor core reads the result of a write, then all subsequent reads by any other processor core will see the same result. \\n\\nCache consistency - write-back, -> stored in buffer. If buffer values need to be replaced or cleaned then write back to main memory. \\nWrite-through- -> through the buffer and straight to memory. \\nWeak consistenct -> no guarantee that reads/writes will have sequential consistency. \\nStore to load forwarding -> can read writes early if on one core. \\n\\nAtomic instruction -> occurs all at once, cannot be interrupted. \\nLock -> memory that follows it is atomic. \\nXchg -> exchanges value stored in register and \\n\\nLfence, sfence -> \\n\\nLfence -> loads (reads) from memory before the fence will complete \\nSfence -> rites to memory are written before write after the fence. \\n\\nMutexes have wait channels so might not cause busy waiting always\\n\\nSemaphore: \\nSem wait: if sem value greater than 0, decrement it. (Acquires)\\nSem signal: increase counter by one (releases, more resource)\\nNo owners\\n\\nBin sem vs mutex: no owner, can start at 1 (which is as if a resource is avail) or 0 (as if resource is unavailable) \\n\\nCondition variable: \\nInforms scheduler whena  thread can run. \\nWhy does cond wait also need to unlock the mutex and go to wait?\\nDue to bad interleaving, it can unlock mutex first, other consumer can produce item and signal, and then producer waits. Ie producer misses a signal because it didn’t wait at the same time it released the mutex. \\n\\nLockset algo can detect data races:\\nOn each access of global mem location, note locks that are not currently heald. \\nIf lockset b ecomes empty, there is no mutex protecting the location, and so we may have a race condition. \\n\\nBenign race conditions: sometimes we don’t mind being inaccurate. \\n\\nTest and set -> atomically mutex. Between when a mutex is tested and set, no other thread can change its value. \\n\\nInterrupts are disabled on the processor that holds the spinlock\\n\\nWe want this so that other threads waiting on the spinlock only busy waits for the short time \\n\\nIe disable interrupts before we acquire the lock, renable them after ew release the lock\\n\\nMemory ordering: like fences\\nRelaxed: nothing. Acquire: read and write to mem after fence can’t be recorded before it\\nRelease: read and write to mem that occur before can’t move after. \\n\\nCache lines states:\\nModified: one cache has valid but it’s dirty and needs to be written back. Others are stale and much invalidate other copies\\n\\nRead write evict. Evict -> write back to memory.\\n\\nCache coherence notes:\\n False sharing -> diff variables, same cache line\\nAlign structure -> data needed to be accessed together are placed together\\nPadding -> align with zeroes\\nContending -> don’t share data from diff proc on same cache line. \\n\\nDeadlock conditions:\\nLimited access\\nNo preemption of resources\\nCircularity in graph of reqs\\nMult independent request \\n\\nPrevent by eliminating one condition:\\nLimited resources exclusive\\nNo preemption on resources\\nIndependent set of requests\\nCircularity in graph of requests\\n\\nHand over hand locking:\\nLock 2 locks, \\n\\nInvoluntary context switch -> quantum. \\nProgram is running in userspace. \\n\\nInterrupted. \\nTrap common (trapframe)\\nTrap entry (determines cause)\\nKtimer process (found reasoni s timer interrupt)\\nScheduler (identify next runnable thread) \\nSched switch (loads in new address space) \\nSwit h stack\\nSwitch frame\\n\\nInterrupts come from devices. Devices raise an interrupt with a number of parameters and an identifier included. The trap common creates the trap frame, which creates trap entry, which determines the cause of the interrupt. After determining the cause, the interrupt is mapped to an interrupt array and code is executed depending on the type of interrupt that happened. \\n\\nSync properties:\\nEfficiency (ie sometimes you want to have memory reordering)\\nSequential consistency (write atomicity between processors, in order reads on a particular processor. ) \\nDisable interrupts -> sometimes used with spinlocks so that threads are allowed to safely acquire the thread before it gets interrupted. \\nCons: wouldn’t know how to handle interrupt if you disable it. \\nTest and set: you test whether a mutex is held, then if it’s not then you atomically swap with it. \\nCould lead to busy waiting. Could lead to ordering issues when there is no sequential consistency guarantee\\nSemaphore: wait. Semaphore signal \\nImple: wait: hold spinlock, check count, if count == 0, acquire wc lock, release spinlock, put self onto wc, when reawake, reqcure lock\\nSignal: acquire lock, increment count, wake one from wait channel, release lock. \\n\\nSync producer and consumer using semaphore? Binary sem -> mutex way. \\nCounting semaphore: have full, empty semaphore variables. Empty starts at buffer size, full starts at 0. Producer decrements ((wait) empty while signaling to full.  Consumer decrements full (wait) while signalling empty \\n\\nLock vs binary semaphore: locks must have owner. Bin semaphore can start at 0 or 1, while lock must start be held. \\n\\nImple of semaphore is startvation free dependingon the implementation f the wait channel. If the wait channel is implemented FCFS, then it should be starvation free. \\n\\nDeadlock are when 4 simultaneous events occur:\\nLimited number of resources \\nNo preemption of resources\\nMultiple independent requests (as opposed to one big one)\\nCyclic graph of requests -> can be alleviated by only acquiring locks in a particular order. \\n\\nWhen just one of these are not there, then there is no deadlock.\\n\\nCondition variable - also wait and signal. A mutex is involved. You must cv wait for the variable while having a mutex as you need to release the mutex at the same time Ie between time you let mutex go and go to sleep, there’s a chance the mutex is acquired and a wake is filed. \\n\\nDeadlock in one thread -> yes. If there is devices that depend on each other/\\n\\nProcess -> has its own address space, heap, code, global variables. \\n\\nThread -> has own stack, registers. \\n\\nNo, cannot access memory across processes. They are in different address spaces. \\nPrivileged mode - direct access to registers, memory, devices. Modify tlb, \\nSystem call -> registers are loaded in userspace, specific identifier register loaded, call an interrupt, kernel creates traf common trap frame, which creates trap entry (determines cause) which determines it to be a syscall entry(), which determines the type of syscall (ie write) when then triggers the appropriate erspose. \\n\\nThere are less physical than virtual addresses\\nMethod of addr translation -> adj linkages, base/bound, segmentation, page table, multi leve page tables. \\nLinkages - add a constant value to sections of code when translation from virtual to physical. \\n\\nValue of dynamic relocation (base bound/ segmentation) changes during a context switch, \\nInternal - unused within block, external unused outside block. \\nPaging advantages -> no external fragmentation (it is all internal) can share resources while also easy scaling (allocate new page as opposed to somehow expanding contiguous space) \\n\\nFinding new places in SSD: allocate anywhere- > external fragmentation. Linked list (and with FAT table), contiguous array of addresses in metadata. \\n\\nPage table -> virtual page number is virt addr % page size. This maps to a physical address. Remaining is added to offset. NEeds to translate more than once if there are multi levels in pages. \\n\\nGEtting virtual from physical: yeah just do it in reverse\\n\\nValid bit: if the data is in memory or not.\\n\\nRoles of OS in addr translation: provide page table, recovery from SSD if not there, update PTE, manage page table, MMU: do the math to convert virtual to physical addr, maintain TLB\\n\\nWhy Does mmu need to invalidate tlb - because we context switch to a different process, and the pid/owner info is not in the tlb so all the virtual addresses are wrong. \\n\\nHardware vs software TLB:\\nHardware -> more complex. IF encounter not in tlb, gets it. \\nSoftware -> raises exception if not in ther\\nSegmentation -> you can share code. You can also place text code imports, stack, in different locations as to not use a contiguous block of memory. \\n\\nTwo processes should share a page? The page is in memory. So yes. There exist synchronization considerations. Should share when using common library. \\n\\nPage tables may be large -> use indirect pointers, make smaller page tables, can make double indirect + if necessary\\n\\nGloval vs local replacement policy: \\n\\nGlobal vs local allocation policy. Global - we replace any page with any pag e. Could even replace another procs page that is stored in memory with cur proc’s page. Ie remove least recently used page of any process.\\nLocal: Must determine how much memory each process should have & which page to evict. \\nLocal -> 80/20 model states that only 20% of memory is really needed\\nCan determine local memory needs usi ng page fault frequency (PFF) \\nIf a process page faults more, then we allocate more pages. We due this until the number of page faults plateaus. Pff = num faults / num instructions executed\\nWorking set vs resident \\n\\nPage fault exception?  - use the mmu to locate the page’s location in SSD (virt to phys translation), pull the data into memory, update the page table,update the TLB, restart the instruction that caused the exception. \\n\\nPage replacement policies -> LRU -> least recently used. FIFO: first in first out. Optimal strategy. Clock algorithm (one pass marks accessed bit from 1 to 0, or 0 to free. Can also do with two hands, where first hand cleared accessed from 1 to 0, trailing hand clears 0 to free list. Final clock algo -> we add extra bits to count how many times a page is accessed. Clear when count is 0. \\n\\nPage replacement locality: \\nTemporal and spatial locatlity. \\nTemporal - when in the program is it used. Will it be used in the future? Does it get accessed in short intervals? (ie keep recently accessed in memory longer)\\nLocality -> Access memory that is close to each other. Algo may prefetch blocks that are near the original blocks\\n\\nFrequency based page replacement policies are bad -> temporal locality -> cannot handle when accessed in bursts, can’t adapt to changes in access patterns. \\n\\nLRU -> lots of data required to manage this info.  -> expensive to manage and maintain. Ie needs to scan and find lowest access time. \\n\\nUse bit & modified bit -> page in use? Ie accessed for clearing. Modified -> marks as dirty and needs to be written back. \\n\\nBelady’s anomaly -> add more pages doesn’t improve number of page faults. Replacement policy is stack if it can be implemented using a stack stack policies are not subject ot belady’s \\n\\nPrefetching -> fetch nearby blocks in hopes that it will be used b/c of spacial locality advantage. \\n\\nWorking set -> 20% working 80% not working. Resident set -> pages in memory. Want resident to hold working. Phase change -> due to the program cycle it changes characteristics and different parts of the program become high in demand. \\nInfo abt working set -> we don’t want to replace those pages because they are highly in use. Maybe LRU would help. \\n\\nLarge page size -> cons: more memory per page requires contiguous block, could have more internal fragmentation for smaller programs. Longer transfer times. Pros - >less search required for memory access, more info per page and faster index for contiguous memory, reduced page table size, fewer page faults, \\n\\nThreshing- > swapping of pages in and out of memory really quickly. Could happen if there is no temporal locality, hot memory doesn’t fit in memory, or there are too many processes.  Resolved if you increase memory . \\n\\nToo many processes running -> memory died and might cause threashing\\nIdeal amount of worokign set to remain in memory -> all of it. None of when when suspended. \\n\\nTypes of schedulers: \\nShortest remaining time first, FCFS, RR, shortest time first, completely fair scheduler, multi level feedback queue\\n\\nMulti level feedback queue - procs that are just waking up get placed in the highest priority queue. Every so often, all threads/procs get moved to highest priority queue to avoid starvation, always complete highest prio jobs before completing lower ones\\n\\nVirtual run time = runtime / weight * total weight\\n\\n4 device registers each device maintains: they each have different registers. \\nProgram controlled i/o vs direct memory access\\nProgram controlled i/o -> we talked abt mem mapped io and port mapped io. Program controlled anything means that we store our data in a buffer and and processor is responsible for moving the data out from the buffer when it wants to. \\nDirect memory access -> rather than writing to a buffer, the the device is responsible for writing straight to the memory. Does not use processor power. \\n\\nTypes of registers - status, command, data. Status -> for checking on the status of the device. Read. Command -> for commanding the device, write. Data -> for data output. Read. \\n\\nBenefits of buffer moving data between program’s address space:\\nDownside -  no true synchronization. If two procs are working and modifying the same piece of data, then they must be synchronized. \\nUpside -> more efficient usage of spatial locality. Ie we can prefetch data into the buffer and use it. We don’t need to always use a costly write operation whenever we do any write operation (to disk. \\n\\nMemory mapping for device:\\nPort mapped io: devices themselves have ports, and the drivers communicate to the devices through the ports\\nMemory mapped io - ram is allocated for the device, and the device reads/writes into a particular locationin ram. \\n\\nRequest service time -> seekt ime + rotational latency + read time. \\n\\n1/x seconds per rotation. 1/x/2 expected rotational latency\\n\\nTransfer time = 1/x * k/T\\n\\nSeek time = k / 3\\n\\nSequential io are stored sequentially in memory so they are accessed without needing to jump around while reading sectors. Ie reduced seek time. Sequential can also prefetch data \\n\\nTrack buffering - having extra delay when moving inwards to account for the time it tkes for a head to arrive at position. \\n\\n6 scheduling algorithms: \\nSCAN, CSCAN, SSTF, FCFS\\n\\nFile -> assigned an inode. Are stored in file system, while are algorithms to handle the organization (retrival, handling) of files.\\n\\noPs on file: write right, change access, copy, idk\\n\\nFile position is adjusted using the file descriptor position, which automatically adjusts in a  sequential manner whenever data is read into a block. Non sequential io is performd by using lseeks, which move the file descriptor position.\\n\\nSeek past end of file -> nothing happens, but then an error happens if you actually try to read it. (ie next op will check)\\n\\nMemory mapped file -> directly mapped into address space?\\n\\nOptions of handling memory mapped file getting updated: write back vs write through caching. And also copy on write -> meaning ie if we fork a process, we use references to the original instructions until we need to write into memory, in which then we copy the original contents over. \\n\\nHardlink -> link to an inumber. Soft link-> link to a string. \\n\\nHardlinks can’t cross file system boundaries because they are designed to be unique within a file system. Ie will not be unique over multiple file systems\\n\\nCommon ways of organizing multiple file systems -> mounting. Build one into another. Put it’s folder in it. Single hierarchical namespace. \\nWindows -> auto mounting. No choice where the mounted device goes. UNIX: choose where mounted device goes. \\nHard links -> changes inumber reference count. Cannot link to folder. Links to inode. Deleting file means all references must be deleted. \\n\\nSoftlinks can cross file system boundaries \\n\\nProblems with soft links -> can link to directory (causes loops), target directory doesn’t need to exist. Target directory could’ve been deleted but it’s okay no referential integrity. \\n\\nFile system fixed chunk vs variable sized chink allocation -> contiguous allocation, file allocation table, linked files, list of pointers. (indexed file) \\n\\nFixed sized is more common (ie page method). \\n\\nLogical block addressing: Practice of placing more sectors on outer portions of track, and less on inner. Upgrade to cylinder head sector addressing \\n\\nInode metadata -> file size, filetype, pointers to datablocks, access permissions, number of references, last access time, last modified time. \\n\\nLarge gaps between sections -> can store new sections? \\n\\nDirectories are files themselves. \\n\\nOpen with symlink has to navigate to the linked reference rather than getting directed to the inode.  \\n\\nCrash recovery: \\nus e fsck\\nMeta data updates are synchronous. \\nOrdered updates. \\nFiles track all the files that it depends on.\\nEacj updated field contains old val, new val, and the updates that depend on this update. \\nJournaling, writing updates such that directories are deleted before files are deleted, files are created before directories are created, write to disk before updating cache, keeping a running list of instructions that are running, and which grouped instruction was run last, selectively rolling back crashed items. \\n\\nProcessors share information via: bus. \\n\\nMemory management unit: \\n\\nBase bound trade off'),\n",

What if she still has feelings? What if she is only saying flowery words for the sake of saying flowery words? What if I’m around for fun?\\n\\nEverything points this in a negative direction. Clare’s mom wants to set up a privacy barrier, which Clare disagreed to. Clare’s mom doesn’t think Clare should go camping with Tristan alone since I’m already in the picture, which I agree. \\n\\nI want Clare to have friends, yes, but I don’t want them to live in the same house as her. Especially if they have history. Why does it have to be this way? It’s such a headache. \\n\\nYes I want to trust her. Yes I want to learn how to trust others. Yes I’m ready to almost go to the ends of the earth for this girl because she means so much to me. \\n\\nSo why is there such a headache then? Why is it that when I see his belongings in the corner my mood takes a 180? Why is it that I want to obscure my actions and not tell Clare I’ve already moved buildings to work? Am I being petty? Am I being deceptive? Do I secretly want to move out? Do I secretly want to quit now that things have gotten challenging? \\n\\nOn that note, it’s terrible. I didn’t expect any good relationship to be easy, but I also didn’t think the challenge would be me getting cucked. Why is this challenge going against the grains of our relationship? How come she claims she’s on the same side as me - she says she doesn’t want Tristan to stay with her - but her actions say otherwise? Her strong attempts to say that nothing has ever happened, her sympathy that sounds pleasing to hear but lack substance within; I don’t know if I can take these words at face value. \\n\\nI don’t want to say I can’t do this. I want to follow her wishes, and say I can get along with the friends that she has. \\n\\nBut surely it’s understandable to be as worried as I am when it’s a guy she has liked before, and they’re living in the same single-roomed studio apartment together? I think anyone in my shoes would act as similarly as I’m acting. I can’t be this worried for nothing right? \\n\\nI want, to build a relationship on trust. A relationship that will not make me exhausted and doubt the validity of the other person’s words. I want to change myself. I want to change this situation. I still like her a lot, but she’d understand if I say I’m tired right? Not of the relationship, but of the situation. There’s no other solution besides me just taking it like a champ.

I feel shame even as I think back to calling Clare both a cow and a whale. I’m only relieved that it was in private, as I wouldn’t want to set a precedence of showing I didn’t like her towards other people. \\n\\nIt’s definitely my fault. Don’t get me wrong. \\n\\nIt’s just\\n\\nHow come my first impression was an unsettling dream of getting cucked. I don’t even want to write about it here, because I don’t want to eventually recall it. How come my self in the the dream thought it was okay, until I realized that I wasn’t and I woke up out of panic. \\n\\nMaybe I’m just a bit psychotic. Clare talks about how when Shri got into trouble with Anushka, he was a bit immature in the way that he panicked. I think I’m doing the same right now, but I wouldn’t want to admit it. As the clock ticks by and eventually we pass from Clare’s wakeup time into Clare’s work time into Clare’s whatever time, I know I’ll be watching that clock go by in pure agony. \\n\\nThis must be the stonewalling effect that she mentioned to me about. \\n\\nNow let’s be sensible. Clare is mad. Clare needs time to not be mad. It’s normal for her to be doing her own routine during this time. I do have a chance to step up and make things better as she’s going to work, though she’s not necessarily taking public transit today as the rental car is still there. \\n\\nThere’s still good reason to be worried. What does good communication mean? If she’s mad at me, she should still tell me, right?\\n\\nAt the same time, I think my tendency to be mean might be something deeply rooted. How come I end up harming those who I cherish the most? \\n\\nA bad excuse is that I just want to be different. When someone asks you - what animal are they - I don’t want to give a cookie-cutter response. I like to defy the norms and give something they don’t expect. \\n\\nBut I did make the slight whale association. I did know that there was a chance it could be taken the wrong way. So why did I say it? \\n\\nI think part of me wanted to see what would happen if things went down that path. I wanted to know if Clare was also a cookie cutter person and would get mad / sad as to what fursona I assign them. But thinking back, this was a really stupid test to run. She’s placed her trust in me, so why would I say something that does not most accurately represent my impression of her? Why would I turn down an opportunity to show her more affection, and instead show her my viciousness? \\n\\nMaybe it’s that I don’t like being forced. But even deeper, maybe it’s that I secretly take enjoyment in doing this. Maybe due to some childhood events I now somehow take pleasure in insulting people, and this will only surface more and more as time goes on and …..\\n\\nYeah, maybe not. I don’t think I’m like that, and I don’t think my childhood was so twisted that I’d become someone twisted as well. \\n\\nHmm, I don’t feel good from writing yet, but it’s at least getting better. I think I’m gradually waking up from the stress of getting dream-cucked. At least, I now know that that style is not the style for me. \\n\\nI hope Clare has a very nice day. I hope that what we have is healthy, on both our ends. Yeah this is painful but there’s a chance it will change me for the better. Yeah this is painful but maybe it will genuinely make me treat Clare better. \\n\\nI do think of the text messages she sent last night nearly 20 minutes after I slept. They talked about seeing a trend in the things that I do. When I slapped her, when I wouldn’t change her nickname to something serious, and now when I called her a cow and a whale in the same call. \\n\\nDo they mean something? Is there a trend among all these events? Are there toxic traits that are deeply rooted inside of me?\\n\\nThe answer is maybe. I might’ve hit her because we always made slapping clapping and violence-related jokes. I didn’t think it would have such a negative impact. The contacts and now the whale event are from much more similar occurrences. Namely, I didn’t like how I was being forced to show affection. I knew what the other person was looking for, and gave them the opposite because either a) I was annoyed b) I was in a position of attention c) a bit of both. \\n\\nNow my motivations really don’t matter as much. How will I prevent this from happening again?\\nNot play dumb games. If Clare is looking for affection, then there’s no need to strategically withhold affection. If our lo mutual liking is right, then there should be no shortage of affection from me to her. \\nBe vocal when I feel like I’m forced to do something. Yes, I think I already do this. I told Clare that I’d do it eventually, and internally I thought that the fursona question was stupid. I think it was just a combination of stupid and stupid. A stupid question led to a stupid response, which resulted in this stupid mess. \\n\\nI think the first bullet will be harder to address. How do I know when I’m about to be a menace again? How can I remember to be kind when in an opportunity where my words matter?\\n\\nHer text ends by saying she hopes we’ll both be better. In my heart, I agree with this. She deserves better than the me from yesterday.\\n8:37am update\\n\\nI’m very annoyed right now. How did a talk about Roe. vs Wade get to me hating women now. That’s not the case. I just don’t feel pity towards a country that did that to themselves. But now that Clare is an American, I hate that they would make her feel these worries. \\n\\nI think I’m justified to say this, but I’m also annoyed at Clare. Why would you bring up my worth in a conversation about values? It’s one of my touch points. I can’t even defend myself right now, there’s no time to do that. Can’t we come to an agreement before we set out on our respective days? \\n\\nI think I need to stand up once Clare gets home. I think she’s being unreasonable knowing that mental solace is what I want, and choosing to argue in the little time we have together. Ironically I’m trying to argue more later, but I think it’s for the greater good. I’m trying to defer the argument until we can both settle something. \\n\\nI somewhat feel as if words are being put into my mouth, and I’m being accused of things I don’t believe in. I take a neutral stance on topics I’m less familiar with, so why am I automatically polarized in one direction? Do I care about the autonomy of women? Yes I do, I care about the autonomy of everyone. Does everyone get autonomy? No they do not, because of the circumstance they were in. Should women in America get autonomy? Yes they should. But also, their president was voted in by their own choice. If a majority vote is what gets presidents in, you should also account for the women who voted to choose no to abortion. Anyways, I don’t have a say on abortion. I’m a guy. They are girls. They go through events that I have an idea of but that I’ll struggle to gain empathy for. \\n\\nI really don’t know what our way out is right now. \\n\\nThe solution is never to give up. \\n\\nThe solution is to put your best foot forward.'),\n",

Its newly renovated facilities communicate Blendtek’s commitment to innovation towards its clients. This implies that Blendtek should search for customers who value Blendtek’s added quality, even if it comes at a greater cost when compared to larger-scale suppliers. They should also continue inviting customers to on-site tours, as it builds the close, interpersonal connections which are crucial to B2B relationships. A second strength is Blendtek’s investments in food-related certifications. Their SFC license, organic certification, and SQF certificates are all official records of food safety and quality. Rather than trying for an additional certification, which may be time-costly to implement, an effective solution would leverage these existing certificates and target customers who value and recognise Blendtek’s existing certificates. Lastly, Blendtek has a strong supply chain which features many diverse products and delivers value to its consumers. As a result, Blendtek should further propagate this value by targeting clients who show interest in utilizing Blendtek’s diverse set of ingredients. \\n\\nConversely, one of Blendtek’s weaknesses is its lack of effective advertising. Though Blendtek increased its blender division's marketing expenditures by 10x in 2024, results have yet to show. Investments in digital advertising (Google, Meta ads) have had little to no impact on Blendtek’s revenue, and Blendtek’s in-house blenders remain far from reaching capacity. An effective solution would reorient Blendtek’s marketing strategy towards a more receptive and valuable B2B audience. A further weakness is that Blendtek has limited expertise and connections outside of food and beverage. Though many of Blendtek’s competitors eventually adopt a dual food / chemical distribution model, Blendtek may not have the internal capabilities to grow in this direction. As Blendtek’s working capital is oriented and certified to operate on food products, Blendtek is better positioned to resolve its food blending issues before transitioning into different industries.\"),\n",

Though it operates as the largest streaming platform in the world and has achieved historical success through aggressive expansion supported by skillful legal, creative, and technical teams, it is struggling to generate new streams of revenue as its addressable market shrinks in size. Its latest success in acquiring subscribers was caused by pricing tactics to get existing consumers to pay more, yet has left no changes in the product. As such, Netflix has stopped reporting quarterly subscriber growth as it recognizes its market saturation and the looming threat of its competitors. An analysis into Netflix’s goals, strategy, structure, and culture has determined that incremental changes should be implemented at Netflix to ensure sustained company growth. Specifically, adjustments to its structure can be made to better align with its goals and culture as Netflix attempts to diversify into more product lines. As the company’s next key challenge is to maintain their current operational momentum while preparing for the future, Netflix’s top 3 objectives should be to diversify their product line, increase satisfaction through innovation, and maintain their current dominant position. To accomplish this, this report proposes the introduction of several new divisions and teams. Under a hybrid model, these new teams will further benefit from improved communication flows and cross-functional departments to help Netflix’s budding product lines to grow.\\n  \\nIntroduction\\n“Netflix has already won the streaming wars”1 is a bold yet current depiction of Netflix’s success. As the largest streaming company in the world, Netflix commands the streaming industry with operations in every country in the world except 7. However, beneath the claims of “millions of new customers” and the “lots of room to grow revenue”Netflix faces the challenges of a maturing business in a competitive industry. To overcome these issues and regain a competitive advantage in the market, this report examines strategic alternatives focusing on diversification sustaining current market share, and employee satisfaction. Our recommendation to enhance Netflix's organizational structure includes improving communication flows, implementing vertical divisions, and creating cross-functional departments. This strategy aims to secure long-term growth and differentiation by sustaining market share, optimizing operations, and fostering an innovative workforce.\\nAnalysis\\nAfter completing a SWOT analysis (Exhibit A), it is clear that Netflix has an efficient system, and is a leader in the streaming market. Revenue is increasing, and they have the most dominant position in the market3. However, Netflix has been raising prices at a rate exceeding competition and are plagued with a culture some describe as “ruthless and demoralizing”. After losing their first mover advantage with competition now also making original content, Netflix is looking for ways to innovate their business, while still staying efficient and sustaining their market share. They have done this by expanding into live programming and video games to attract new audiences, relieving some of their dependance on North America by expanding globally, and with the adoption of an ad-supported model to bolster revenues and remain cost leaders. To see a more in depth analysis of the company’s fit with the external environment, see exhibit D. . But, for any of this to be successful while still maintaining momentum, Netflix has to implement some organizational changes internally. Does this mean changing their structure? Transforming their culture? Netflix needs to evaluate alternative ways they can move forward with their business. \\nDecision Criteria\\nTo sustain and grow our current market share while maintaining the organizational capability to satisfy existing customers, we must structure an effective strategy that:\\nDiversifies new product lines to reach a wider market\\nImproves employee satisfaction and productivity by fostering innovation to retain talent and reduce employee turnover\\nMaintains Netflix’s current dominant position\\nBy focusing on these areas, Netflix can sustainably grow our market share, create innovative products, and build a motivated and stable workforce.\\nAlternative 1: Hybrid Model\\nThe first alternative is for Netflix to balance the present and the future by diversifying their product line while satisfying existing customers’ needs. In this alternative, new teams are formed to separately handle the entertainment, games, and live show product lines. As these teams will resemble the existing horizontal teams that Netflix possesses, this change requires less organizational restructuring. This is best implemented via a hybrid company structure as shown in Exhibit B.\\nThe primary benefit of creating teams is better adaptability within unstable environments. As Netflix has historically focused on licensing and producing television shows, it must adopt a learning orientation as it expands beyond its current scope. Teams should be built for horizontal coordination and extensive communication outside the company, which allows for strong team cohesion, higher employee satisfaction and environmental responsiveness. This enables Netflix teams to capture the latest environmental changes, such as cultural trends or customer feedback, then act responsively on these factors to best develop their new product offerings. \\nThe vertical components of the proposed hybrid structure act to unify Netflix as a brand and communicate upper management’s support for innovation. This is implemented via separate top-level finance and marketing departments, which collaborate with the finance and marketing teams within individual product lines. The top-level marketing department serves to maintain Netflix’s strategic alignment in rebranding as a general entertainment company. As Netflix expands into these new product lines, their core vision as a transitioning company should remain consistent via inter-team campaign coordination and aligned brand messaging. Meanwhile, the top-level finance department serves to allocate budget for innovative ventures. As Netflix’s core competencies lie outside of creating games and broadcasting live shows, Netflix teams should not hesitate to acquire innovation via external recruitment and acquisition.\\nA final structural addition refers to the innovation hubs, or Netflix Labs, incorporated throughout Netflix offices. This team intends to foster a culture of innovation at Netflix, and demonstrate that Netflix may achieve bottom-line success outside of squeezing value out of employees by investing further into R&D. \\nAlternative 2: Transnational Streaming Product\\nThe second alternative positions Netflix as one of the global dominant streaming services for performance, learning, and diversification. It anticipates high volumes of global demand while adapting against consumer perceptions. In this alternative, Netflix adopts a decentralized business structure that relies on its international divisions’ innovations to remain competitive. This is a strong benefit for Netflix, as the volatility in the entertainment industry forces Netflix’s globally distributed divisions to innovate and consequently for the company to grow. Regionally, Netflix divisions act with autonomy but retain their existing company structure to remain responsive with the environment.\\nHowever, certain factors limit the feasibility of the alternative. The decentralized approach of a transnational structure hinders Netflix’s ability to reshape its brand as an entertainment company, as it would require extensive coordination across distant divisions. Though Netflix’s international divisions remain capable of adding new product lines, there will be challenges in unifying these new products as operations may need to be synchronized across the company in order to create a consistent brand image.\\nAlternative 3: Cost Optimization\\nOne of the alternatives for Netflix to maintain their competitive advantage is to establish a cost leadership focused vertical structure. By consolidating control, Netflix can strengthen their operational efficiency. This would mean the integration of all levels of business within a more vertical unified management structure. This should enhance the coordination process by lowering operational costs and speeding up decision-making.\\nNow that Netflix is a more mature company, product and infrastructure optimization is important. Efficient allocation of resources minimizes waste and allows the firm to allocate available resources towards customer facing improvements. Moreover, cost leadership could help Netflix in its capability of offering quality content at an attractive price point necessary for the continuous attraction and retention of subscribers. This aligns with some of Netflix’s most recent moves as they are looking to increase revenues. They have recently announced that they will be removing their mid tier $9.99 subscription option in favor of a $5.99 option that provides ads. This proves that Netflix is moving in the direction of a cost-leadership strategy as they are offering lower prices in the hopes of making up that revenue through advertisements.\\nHowever, the disadvantages of this alternative are evident. Centralizing control would make the organization less flexible. This would hamper Netflix's ability to respond to the market in a timely manner. Moreover, cutting down on operational costs may come at the expense of the quality and quantity of content.\\nRecommendation\\nOut of all the listed alternatives, we recommend that Netflix mature as a business by transitioning from a focus on efficiency to a system that balances both efficiency and innovation. By implementing more information flow throughout the organization and fostering innovation internally across different departments horizontally. We believe that this approach will allow Netflix to sustain its current market share with a centralized brand image, differentiate its product offerings enabling innovation, improving organizational culture and employee satisfaction, and optimize its current products while still driving growth. \\nImplementation Plan:\\nProduct Line Group Restructuring\\nHorizontal teams will be implemented via mass hiring from the HR heads of different teams. These hires may come internally or externally, but are contingent on their transferable and applicable skills to Netflix’s new video game and live show product lines. Initial staff will be hired within months 1-2, and teams will be maintained as lightweight and agile until further scaling is needed. Next, representatives of marketing / finance are chosen from existing top-level structures and the newly created teams. These people will be recruited to form the functional aspect of marketing / finance teams. This will also be implemented during months 1-2 and will be implemented via evaluating employees’ performance feedback and technical ability within the team. \\nImplementing Improved Communication Flows\\nChief Operating Officer (COO), Senior Management, Functional Staff. What: Establish a communication framework to create a better flow of centralized communication, information, and accessibility from senior managers to staff. When: Implementation during Months 3-4. Where: Establish this communication framework across all Netflix offices globally, it would be a standard to be used in every Netflix office to improve communication between senior managers and staff. How: Executives will communicate in bi-weekly direct report meetings with senior managers who will then run weekly stand up meetings with the staff members they manage, to ensure that all relevant information is being passed down as required.\\nCreate Netflix Labs Group to Foster Innovation\\nThe Chief Product Officer (CPO), Product Management Leads, and Functional Staff will make up a Netflix Labs division, with a team made up of members across different departments (e.g. Engineering, Marketing, Sales) that are specifically focussed on research and development of new products, and improving current products / processes for each department, Content Production, Live Shows, and Netflix Games. Implementation will take place during months 5-6 across all Netflix offices globally. These Netflix Labs groups will be led by a Lab Lead. They select staff members across different functions within their assigned office to join the team. Each  team will report to the Chief Product Officer.\\nContingency Plan:\\nRegular Monitoring and Adjustments - Communication System & Vertical Departments\\nIf improvements to communication flow and process efficiency are not seen within 7 months after initial implementation, a task force will be made up of senior-level employees within each department level who are familiar with the processes and communicating internally the best, collaborating with the department leads of each function, as well as the COO to ensure that process inefficiencies are identified.\\nRegular Monitoring and Adjustments - Netflix Labs\\nAfter a Netflix Labs group is made and releases a new product or innovation, a customer focus group will be formed for 3 months after the launch / creation of the product. This group will provide in-depth feedback. If it is found that customer satisfaction is low - the lab leads & CPO will focus on changing product strategy, potentially restructuring members of the teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nExhibit A - SWOT Analysis \\n\\nExhibit B - Proposed Hybrid Model\\n\\nExhibit C - Proposed Vertical Model\\n\\n\\nExhibit D - Principle of Fit Analysis:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\nAnderson, D.

They are backed with decades of experience, legacy, and technological expertise that could convince even cautious, foreign customers into a contract. Their investments towards cutting edge technology is capable of creating custom precision equipment in-house, showing resilience towards supply chain disruptions without sacrificing performance. They are also highly committed to quality and innovation, with their deep investments into R&D and TQM defining their brand image, acting as a sustainable competitive advantage, and pioneering for their future in the manufacturing space. Given the personalized nature of B2B selling, GST Group holds the capability to charm their clients if given the chance. \\n\\nNote: Doesn’t mention beautiful manicured garden, ultra modern new plant, batch production for quality\\n\\nHowever, as a small-medium sized company, GST group lacks the capital and the economies of scale. They have been pushed out of industries (radiators) where costs dictate the purchasing decision. While they have found their niche competing on quality, they are constrained towards producing in small, custom batches. This implies pieces in excess are unlikely to be resold, and losses in clients to be detrimental. They are highly dependent on exports as it generates 90% of their revenue, revealing a susceptibility towards global supply chain disruptions. \\n\\n\\nCompetitive analysis:\\nThreat of customer vertical integration - The customers themselves are manufacturers, who also have incentive to vertically integrate themselves. We see this in Suzuki Motor Corp and Tata Motors, who deployed a new aluminium based technology for manufacturing radiators. \\n\\nRental manufacturing machines - some manufacturers may rent machines. But we need to show them that ours are better and worth the price. \\n\\nManufacturers had always wanted to be one stop shops for their customers -> more sign of negative vertical integration. \\nhigh degree of control over production schedules, quality assurance, and delivery timelines.\\n\\n\\n\\nGST Group is a manufacturer selling to a manufacturer in a B2B environment. As such, there is a severe threat of vertical integration from our own customers. Suzuki Motor Corp and Tata Motors are both examples of possible clients who outcompeted GST Group after choosing to integrate vertically. Smaller scale competitors follow the same pattern, with frequent manufacturers choosing machine rentals and sharing a desire to also become a one-stop-shop for their customers. As such, GST Group should position themselves to be irreplaceable. By resolving the main challenges and offering the main benefits of vertical integration, such as offering consumer control over production schedules, quality assurance, and delivery timelines, GST Group may secure its place among its customers/competitors.'),\n",

Describe the call stack\\nSystem call is called from main as it is an APi. This could be a “write” call \\nThe wrapper itself executes int 60 on the user side, which generates an interrupt corresponding to a system call. This is done after the system call parameters indicating type and values on the system call is loaded. Next, int 60 corresponds to a particular syscall exception in kernelspace, which is then raised and the kernel jumps to the address of the syscall and executes it. Afterwards, Trap frame is called. This traps all the registers and what not of the user level, to preserve registers if necessary. Next, it calls trap entry to determine the cause of the trap frame. Because it’s a syscall that is responsible for the trap frame, the trap_entry calls syscall entry. After writing thestatement, executing the code and whatnot, the result is passed back to userspace. \\n\\nHow does fork work? What does it return?\\nFork returns 0 to the child, and the process ID of the child to the parent. \\n\\nWhat is a semaphore? How is it related to locks\\nA semaphore and a lock are different because they have no owners and can be initialized to 0. We can implement a semaphore using locks. \\n\\nWhat calls can you apply on threads? (ie pthread wait)\\nCreate, yield, destroy, wait\\n\\nWhat does volatile do? Does it prevent race conditions?\\nIt prevents compiler optimizations that assumes variables are not changed outside the current execution context. \\nWhat is an address space?\\nThis is where program is stored. \\nDescribe the producer consumer interaction\\n\\nWhy do we isolate kernel from users?\\n\\nWhy use multiple threads rather than multiple processes\\n\\nBinary semaphore vs lock?\\n\\n What are condition variables / cv_wait?cv_signal?\\n\\n\\nSemaphores!\\n\\nCondition variables!\\n\\nSynch slides:\\n\\nCritical sections:\\nThe part of a concurrent program where a shared resource is accessed\\nReminder that all threads in a concurrent program share access to program’s code, global variables, heap and open files. They also share access to secondary storage, display…\\n\\nSynchronization:\\nCoordination of access to a shared resource\\n\\nRace condition:\\nWhen the program result depends on order of execution\\n\\nSequential consistency:\\nExecution is as if all ops were executed in some sequential order\\nSometimes there’s a slight delay for a shared variable to be stored back into one core then synced to other cores. \\nHappens because write of each thread is buffered. Program continues without waiting for the write to complete. \\nThreads read from ram when read is an addr not stored in their own write buffer. However, this only works for single core processors, as in multiple cores the addr might be stored in someone else’s write buffer. \\nSometimes writes are going to go to two different memory modules. So despite ordering in code, the write may still occur at different times. \\nBecause the write occurs at different times, it’s also important for the reads to occur in order. Because if we have logic that states one write => all other writes are finished => then it requires reads to be sequentially consistent. \\nSystem must:\\nMaintain order when write follows read\\nMaintain order between two write operations\\nMaintain order between two read operations\\n\\nCache line:\\nUnit of data transfer between core and caches\\nWrites may get reordered as an optimization. \\n\\nCache coherence:\\nChanges in one cache must be propagated to other caches. \\n\\nWrite atomicity \\nif processor reads result of a write, then all subsequent reads will see the same result\\n\\nWrite buffer: \\nHolds data that is abt to be written to RAM. \\n\\nSequential consistency impedes hardware optimizations because:\\nCannot use write buffers, which allow the next instruction to execute before data is stored into RAM\\nCannot re order overlapping write ops. \\nComplicates non-blocking reads.: ie cannot prefetch data because there are multiple memory cores that exist\\nCache coherence becomes more expensive because you must delay write completion until its values in other caches are marked as invalid or updated. \\n\\n\\nCache weak-consistency: \\nNo guarantee that reads and writes will have sequential consistency\\n\\nStore to load forwarding:\\nCore can read its own writes early. \\n\\nAtomic instruction:\\nInstruction that cannot be interrupted. i.e. no other core can access the memory value until the instruction has complete\\nLock -> makes the memory instruction that follows it atomic\\nXchg -> exchange value stored in a register with the value stored in main memory\\nXchg is always locked\\nCmpxchg -> compares two values and exchanges if they are different. \\nFence instructions can prevent reordering. \\nLfence -> all lods from mem prior to lfence will complete before and loads after\\nSfence -> all stores from mem prior to sfence will complete before any stores after sfence are executed\\nMfence -> comb of lfence and sfence\\n\\nIntrinsic function:\\nAllows for use of assembly language instructions similar to a processor family like it was C / C++\\n\\n\\nProducer consumer:\\nProducer: produces data\\nConsumer: consumes data\\nThere is a limited number of buffer space. Producer would wait if buffer is full, and consumer would wait if buffer is empty\\nWe need to protect critical sections from concurrent execution\\nWith mutexes, call thread_yield to let another thread to run when buffer is completely full for producer, or when buffer is completely empty for consumer. \\nAfter yielding, get placed into a wait queue and the kernel wakes it up when the other thread has unlocked the mutex.  -> may cause busy waiting\\n\\nMutex: \\nAllows only one thread to have access to a piece of code at a time. \\nCan use mutex lock and mutex unlock to ensure only one thread can run at a time, even if both try to lock it simultaneously. \\nFunctions\\nPthread mutex init\\nPthread mutex destroy\\nPthread mutex lock\\nPthread mutex unlock\\nPthread mutex trylock -> non blocking\\n\\n\\n\\nBusy waiting: \\nThread uses processor time while waiting. Is inefficient. \\n\\nSemaphore: \\nSynchronization primitive that can be used to enforce mutual exclusion requirements. \\nFunctions:\\nSem wait: if value greater than 0, decrement by 1\\nSem signal: increment the value of the semaphore by one\\nA thread will wait until the semaphore count is greater than 0 before continuing\\nTwo types of semaphores:\\nBinary semaphore: behaves like a mutex but does not keep track of ownership\\nCounting semaphore: semaphore with an arbitrary number of resources\\nImplementing:\\nInit semaphore to 1\\nSem wait on both threads or something to decrement by 1 ->0. Other thread will wait until it is > 1 to then execute. \\nFor the buffer example:\\nYou init 2 semaphores: empty and full. \\nEmpty is init to be buffer size, \\nFull is init to be 0\\nProducer waits (decrements empty) every single time before it produces something. It will not produce if empty is 0, meaning the buffer is full. Meanwhile, consumer signals (increments empty) every single time it consumes something, emptying the buffer. \\nProducer signals (increments full) every single time after it produces something. Consumer waits (decrements full) every single time before it consumes something, meaning it will only run if there are items in the buffer. \\nThis method is better because it allows producer and consumer to produce and consume at different rates. Ie producer, if faster, can fill up the buffer rather than waiting for a handoff to occur. It stops filling once the buffer is full. Meanwhile, the consumer only starts consuming once there are items in the buffer, and signals that there is additional space in the buffer whenever it consumes something. \\n\\nCondition variables:\\nCan inform the scheduler when a thread can run. \\nAllow threads to wait for arbitrary conditions to become true while the thread is waiting outside a critical section. \\nWorks by doing a cond_signal or cond broadcast (ie conditional variable signal) from the condition checker that notifies any blocked threads. \\nWhen the new thread wakes up, the kernel will ensure that it holds the mutex. \\n\\nFunctions\\nPthread cond init\\nPthread cond wait. (will unlock the mutex, sleep until condition variable is signalled, and reacquire the mutex)\\nCond wait and mutex unlock go hand in hand. \\nPthread cond signal: wake up one thread waiting for condition c\\nPthread cond broadcast: wake up all threads waiting for condition c. \\nSignalling to condition variable that has no blocked threads does nothing. Signals do not accumulate. \\nProducer consumer analysis:\\nProducer: repeatedly signals towards the nonempty variable. This tells people watching nonempty that it is nonempty. If buffer is full, it will be caught in a check. Then, it will unlock the mutex, sleep until nonfuull is triggered, then reacquire the mutex. \\nConsumer: repeatedly signals the nonfull variable. Tells producer that it is nonfull. If the buffer is empty, then the consumer will unlock the mutex, wait till non empty is signalled, then reacquire the mutex. \\nWe use while loops because by the time we receive the mutex, another consumer may have grabbed the item before the original consumer wakes up. Thus, we must recheck the condition on wakeup. \\nWhy is cond_wait include the mutex unlock and lock? It’s because the producer can end up waiting even though the condition is true because it missed the signal. \\n\\nBenign race conditions:\\nAllowing for race conditoisn could have greater efficiency. Ie when speed better than accuracy. \\n\\nHow to detect data race?\\nLockset algorithm\\nFor each global memory location, keep a lockset. \\nIe if there are 4 locks in the program, create vector (1, 1, 1, 1)\\nOn each access of a global variable location, keep note of which locks are not currently being held\\nIf lockset becomes empty, there is no mutex protecting this memory location. \\nReword: on each global var access, you check if all locks in the program are used. If they are not, then the var access is not  secure and can be prone to race conditions. \\n\\nCourse grained and fine grained locking\\nCoarse grained: create one lock for whole data structure\\nFine grained: create one lock for each linked list in the data structure\\nCoarsegrained: if the DS is not used that often\\nFind grained: if DS is being used often and maximixing concurrency and performance is the goal\\nStrat: identify where there is contention (waiting for a particular resource) and use fine grained locking in those areas. \\n\\nTest and set:\\nBetween when a mutex is tested and set, no other thread can change its value\\nIe test when mutex is locked, then lock it. \\nRecall that xchg swaps value stored in register src with value stored at address addr atomically \\nCode looks like:\\n\\t\\nWe want to be able to put it into a while loop, ilke while (test and set)\\nSo then if test and set returns true, i tmeans the lock was not acquired. Otherwise, the lock was acquired. \\nSetting v->mutex = 0 is the same as unlocking it. \\nThere is a danger with unlocking mutexes. Must ensure all writes are done before mutex is unlocked otherwise any stored values might not be saved inside of other cores. \\nHow do we know that v->val++ was not executed before the while? \\nTest and set uses xchg, which is always locked ie making a fence. \\nVolatile:\\nTo address above problem, can use asm volatile (“sfence” ::: “memory”) to store all items in memory before the fence. \\n\\nSpinlocks:\\nSpinlock: lock that spins. -> tests locks availability in a loop until the lock is acquired. \\nThreads that use spinlocks busy wait. \\nInterrupts are disabled on the processor that holds the spinlock. (ie since spinlocks cause busy waiting, we make each spinlock operation quite short so nothing has to spin for a long time)\\nHow it works: \\t\\nWhile atomic swap(lock addr, true) == 1 (ie not swapping): spin!\\nRegister the CPU that holds the lock after\\nSpinlock unlock:\\nMake sure we’re unlocking on the right CPU\\nAtomic set lock addr to 0\\n\\n\\nMemory ordering\\nMemory_order relaxed - no specific memory ordering required\\nMemory order acquire - read / write to memory that occur after cannot be reordered before it\\nMemory order release - reads and writes to memory that occur before it cannot move after it. \\nMemory order acq rel - comb of prev two\\nMemory order seq cst - full sequential consistency\\n\\nAtomic typing:\\nReading and writing to the variable will always reflect a consistent value \\n\\nSpinlocks: - there is no waiting or yielding to other threads while holding the spinlock\\n\\n\\nCache coherence - system must ensure that out of date caches (stale) do not cause problems\\n\\nConsistency: apparent ordering of reads and writes to memory as viewed from different cores. \\n\\nCache lines:\\nTypically 64 bytes that is transferred to different caches or main memory to take advantage of locality of reference \\nStates:\\nModified: one cache has a valid copy. That copy is dirty. Out of date copies are called stale. \\nShared\\nInvalid: doesn’t contain the data\\n\\nCores and busses can read, write, evict (writeback contents to memory if modified), \\n\\nCache stuff:\\nAvoid false sharing (avoid placing data used by different threads in the same cache line, so that when one writes the other doesn’t become dirty), align structure to cache lines, pad data structures (to avoid false sharing), avoid contending on cache lines\\n\\nDeadlock: \\nDangerous to acquire locks in different orders. Processes may wait on each other to release locks, and threads will wait on each other forever. \\nCould also happen with condition variables, or combined mutex/condition variable deadlock\\nDangerous to hold locks while crossing abstraction barriers. \\n\\nDeadlock conditions\\nLimited access (mutual exclusion, there are resources that cannot be shared between resources)\\nNo preemption of resources (once resource granted, it cannot be taken away, cannot take resource away externally)\\nHold and wait (do not ask all at once. do not wait for next resource while holding current one) (there are devices that have multiple requests and hold preexisting ones) \\nCircularity in graph of requests. (ie a waits on b waits on c waits on a\\n\\nSince all have to hold for a deadlock to happen, we can prevent deadlock with a partial order on resources. \\n\\nIe always acquire mutexes in a specific order. \\n\\nWait channels:\\nMutexes, semaphores, condition variables all use wait channels. \\nThey manage a list of sleeping threads. \\nIe each mutex gets its own wait channel. \\nWhen a thread cannot proceed because of a block in resources, it sleeps on the corresponding wait channel \\nWhen a thread sleeps on a wait channel, the thread scheduler is informed to remove that thread from the list of runnable threads until it is woken up \\nWe need to lock the wait channel before using it so multiple threads simultaneously update the wait channel. Ie it is atomic. \\n\\nWorks with thread scheduler. Ie thread waiting for mutex m1 waits on m1’s wait channel\\n\\nFunctions\\nWaitchannel_lock - lock wait channel for sleep and wake operations\\nWaitchannel_sleep - blocks calling thread on wait channel wc, puts it to sleep\\nThreads call waitchannel sleep, putting itself to sleep and informing the scheduler  that it is sleeping and to remove it from the list of runnable threads. \\nWaitchannel wakeall - unblocks all threads sleeping on the wait channel\\nThese threads are then scheduled to execute. This doesn’t mean that they all acquire the lock. \\nWaitchannel_wake - unblocks one thread sleeping on the wait channel. \\nHow it works:\\nA is called and locks a mutex before proceeding with its critical section\\nB, C are called but find the mutex in use, so it calls waitchannel sleep on itself (atomically) and both enter a sleeping state, where it then cannot be executed by the scheduler. \\nOnce a finishes its critical section, it calls waitchannel all or waitchannel wake  and either B or C or both B and C are made runnable. \\nThe scheduler then decides whether B or C will receive the lock next. \\n\\n\\nHand over hand locking:\\nHold at most 2 locks, prev and next one. Used under find grained locking for concurrent access to a single data structure\\n\\n\\nPart cop, part facilitator: \\nOS provides protection from programs and hackers and also provides an abstract interface to the underlying system\\n\\nApplication view: provided services. System view: problems that it solves\\n\\nKernel: part of os that responds to sys calls, interrupts, exceptions. (that’s it??)\\nSyscalls, interrupts and exceptions and communication between applications and the hardware\\n\\nUserspace - all programs that run outside the kernel\\n\\nKernelspace - the region of memory where the kernel runs\\n\\nTypes of OS: Library OS (lib of standard services, simplifying assumptions such as one progrm at a time), multitasking OS (mult processes existing at same time. One process blocks means other process runs), multi user os (protection to serve distrustfulusers, buggy apps)\\n\\nKernels - monolithic (entire OS in kernel), microkernel (only necessary parts in kernel), hybrid (bit of both), real time os - yeah\\n\\nMonolithic is faster than microkernel because system calls are kernel functions rather than userspace calling kernel space functions. \\nMicrokernel is more stable because faulty drivers would disable the entire kernel rather than just the driver app. \\n\\nProcess - instance of a running program. Could also be an environment where an application program runs. \\nEnv could include processor (threads), main memory (address space), secondary storage (file system), peripherals (device and I/O)\\n\\nProcesses are isolated from each other. Each process gets exclusive access to the processor, primary memory, secondary storage\\nIe the same memory addr that each  process sees are same in virtual mem and diff in physical mem. \\nProcess: text at bottom, then vars, then heap. Then stack grows from top. \\n\\n\\nUser view functions:\\nFork: returns a new process taht is an exact copy of the current one. For parent, this function returns process id of new process. For child, this returns 0\\nMakes sense because we might want the parent to be able to check whether the child has finished\\nWaitpid: attempt to get exit status of the child. Could put the pid or -1 repping any child. Can also customize to either wait for the while to terminate using “0”, or WNOHANG to not wait for the child to finish. Returns process ID or -1 on error. \\nExit: current process exits. 0 is success, non 0 is error. \\nKill: sends signal sig to process pid. \\nGetpid: returns pid of current proc\\nExecv: changes the program that a process is running. If that program succeeds, the base program also terminates. If it fails, then returns to original program. \\n\\nSignal:\\nSoftware interrupt. Sigterm is most common value, kills process but cleans up. Sigkill just kills. \\n\\nSystem calls:\\nAPI that programmers use to interact with kernel\\nHow printf is run: app calls lib wrapper fn, which makes a sys call to transport to kernel space, then after execution the kernel returns result to wrapper fn which returns to application program\\n2 protection modes: kernel mode and user mode\\nKernel mode can access all processor instructions + registers, enable disable interrupts, control syscall interfact, modify TLB, and interact directly with peripherals ie mouse, keyboard, monitor, wifi\\nKernel can also protect itself and isolate processes from each other. \\n\\nInterrupts: \\nGenerated by devices\\nInterrupt handler services device request. Can be disabled unless they are non-maskable. \\nProcess ex: physical signal -> processor interrupts execution of current program -> executes interrupt handler in privilege mode\\n\\nExceptions:\\nGenerated by processor while executing instruction\\nHandled by interrupting execution, transferring control to the exception handler and executing in privileged mode \\n\\nCaller save - person who called must save it. Not preserved across subroutine calls. \\n\\nCallee saved - will save even after function is called. Ie the subroutine that is called will save the registers. \\n\\nMinimizes situations where callee is saving values that the caller is not using. \\n\\nABI: contract between app functions and sys calls\\n\\nCaller saved registers - not preserved across function calls. \\nCallee saved registers - preserved across function calls. \\n\\nSystem calls:\\nPerformed using the T_SYSCALL vector. (integer). \\nSyscall arguments loaded into registers, sys call number loaded into special register\\nExec int 60 (int: interrupt, 60: syscall)\\nProcessor looks up interrupt vector (60), jumps to corresponding addr, then returns to userspace and usermode using theiret instruction .\\n\\nEssentially, you have to load all sys call values (registers, syscal type). Thenyou exec int 60 which is a system call. \\n\\nInterrupts, exceptions, and syscalls all use trap . \\n\\nKernel stack - kernel cannot rely on userspace data structures. Kernel maintains own stack for running kernel code ie interrupts, exceptions, system calls\\nTrap frames:\\nTo handle interrupt, sys must save all register values. \\nWe save in the kernel stack because interrupt can occur at any time, meaning app program may not be able to save any caller save registers before being interrupted. \\n\\nTracing printf:\\nUserspace: printf is called, write() is called (write is a wrapper in userspace)\\nKernel space: Trap common stores registers, syscall is done, (syscall first stores everything, stores exception value into rdi, then executes int 60 prompting an interrupt,int 60 then corresponds to the syscall exception, which returns an address that is then jumped to. It then executes and returns its value in userspace), syscall write then prompts the console device driver, which returns a value that is eventually passed back to write. \\n\\n\\nThread: \\nSchedulable execution context.\\nSequential programs consist of a single thread. \\nThreads share code, global variables, heap and file descriptors \\nPreemptive multitasking - threads appear to run at the same time. \\nParallelism: threds run at the same time because there is hardware support for it\\nBenefits of threads: more light weight, responsiveness (diff threads for different purposes), priority (ie can choose to load the img thread first), \\nContext switch -> switch from one thread to another. Could happen when thread yields, is blocked, or waiting / sleeping. \\nPreemption -> thread involuntarily stops running. Could happen when it exceeds its scheduling quantum. \\nDiagram:\\n\\n\\nContext switch from timer interrupt:\\nUser stack -> in main frame to start. \\nTimer interrupt is an called, sched scheduler identifies the next runnable thread in ready, sched_switch, thread_switcharch, switchstack, switchframe, \\nSwitch stack \\n\\nSyscall process\\nPrintf is called, which calls write in userspace. The userspace write raises an interrupt and also\\n\\nThread interface:\\nCreate - create thread that execs fn with arguments arg\\nDestroy (exit) -> destroy current thread, return pointer to return value\\nWait (join) -> wait for thread to exit and receive its return value\\nYield -> run another thread if available.\\n\\n1:1 user/kernel thead\\nEvery thread operation (ie create, exit, join, yield) must go to the kernel through a system call\\nLess system resources to init because not as much is copied over into the new thread (not as much is copied) \\nForces a one-size-fits all implementation, meaning that each kernel thread will be given a fixed-size stack\\n\\nN:1 threads:\\nThreads are instead in userspace. Mult threads per kernel\\nAllocate a new stack for each pthread_create\\nReplace blocking calls with non-blocking calls. When calls block, just run a different thread instead. \\nCons: cannot take advantage of multiple processors or cores. \\nA blocking system call blocks all threds. \\nPossible deadlock if one blocks on another \\n\\nN:m threading:\\nSame problems as n:1 threads.

What is it even that’s currently haunting me. What’s gotten me so on edge and acting so unreasonably? \\n\\nI hope that writing this doc will make me aware of what is going on to me. \\n\\nList of thoughts:\\n\\nHow much does Clare like me back?\\nI think most of these are unreasonable, but I’ll say them regardless. She doesn’t keep a shared album of me, she’s afraid of going official. OK that’s all that I have to say. She’s still a very kind person at heart, and it was heartwarming seeing how excited she was to go brazilian waxing of all places today. I think I should send her a quick text tonight. \\n\\nWhat’s going on with Khloe?\\nCall me delusional but I’m not comfortable with how closer Khloe has gotten. Whenever I’d put my hand on her chair, she’d move her body to touch my hand. It’s happened twice even when I’m just leaning on her chair to talk to Jessie or Kevin. Also, she’s been playfully hitting me so much more. I think I’m reading too much into it, and it’s definitely a “CS kid who doesn’t interact with women” type of response. Regardless, it has me feeling very conflicted, and I think it should stop. \\n\\nI worry for my grades\\nI saw Howe’s midterm for CS350 today, and it looks challenging. Part of me wishes I paid more attention in class. But it’s okay, it’s not the end of the world yet, we can still recover it. \\n\\nPart of me is worried I can’t complete the DP question using a bottom up approach, which would be easier to justify in terms of runtime. I suppose there’s not much I can do about it right now, unless I go through all the examples using a bottom up manner. \\n\\nOB should be fine in the end, but I feel like I’ve been studying for it wrong. \\n\\nOPS I’m not worried\\n\\nI worry for my future\\nEverything is uncertain, just as uncertain as whether I’d still pick up my ML book to read tomorrow. Just as uncertain as I’d find a job, or move myself closer to Clare. I can’t be dumb. Surely not. I just hope I can pull through, and that I can thrive in a new environment so I can finally do the things that I want to do. \\n\\nWhat should I change? \\nI don’t think it’s the fact that I stopped listening to music that’s causing it. I think it’s the time sink that I mentally allocate to doing things that’s changing my mentality. Spending more time with others means spending less time to myself studying or spending less time with Clare. It feels like my time spending goals have become misaligned, and sometimes I just want to be antisocial. \\n\\nBut at the same time, I value my friends. I’m not myself if I don’t do that. I must figure out a way to value my own time as well as my friends. Find an excuse to run off and do my own thing. I think even if I do that, my friends would still understand\\n\\nI also think I should stop teasing Khloe about Waylon. I hope they get together so even if she’s doing what I hope she’s not doing, then at least she may then focus on herself. \\n\\nAnyways, that was comforting. I’ll go to sleep now.

Where “Streaming entertainment replaces Linear TV” - providing customers with on-demand, personalized entertainment from any device, on any screen. \\n\\nProviding everyone everywhere access to quality content globally. Focusing on expanding Netflix global audiences to all countries around the world - with an emphasis on improving the products ability to be streamed in different languages, regions, and more.\\n\\nInternal Goals: Internal Goals: Encourage decision-making by employees Share information openly, broadly and deliberately Communicate candidly and directly Keep only our highly effective people Avoid rules\\n\\n\\nInternally / Organization:\\n\\nInternal Goals: Creating an equitable, inclusive, and diverse workplace. Promoting equal opportunities within the organization for growth and employment, creating an environment in which all employees feel respected and valued. Internal Goals: Encourage decision-making by employees Share information openly, broadly and deliberately Communicate candidly and directly Keep only our highly effective people Avoid rules\\n\\n\\nPractices include:\\n\\nEquitable pay - Netflix is constantly monitoring for any pay disparities, and close them out when they occur. Analyzing compensation and doing annual compensation reviews\\nEquitable Benefits: flexible parental leave policy, a family forming benefit, and transgender and non-binary care in our U.S. health plans.\\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs) - Netflix has various ERG’s that provide communities for employees. There are 18 ERGs serving Latino/a/x, veteran, Black, and disability communities\\n\\nhttps://jobs.netflix.com/inclusion\\n\\nEmployee  Wellness / Wellbeing - Netflix prides itself on ensuring that employees are able to have a good work-life balance, and are able to thrive in their role by providing them with things like flexible work hours, different options such as remote, hybrid work, wellness programs like gym memberships and wellness funds. In general ensuring that employees are given good benefits to help with their wellbeing in and out of the workplace. They provide benefits to “enhance productivity through the lens on inclusion, so our employees can focus on entertaining the world.” \\n\\nBenefits include:\\nParental Leave (4-8 months)\\nTime Away (35 days annually PTO) \\nFamily Forming & Reproductive Support (Netflix cover’s costs for family forming services, travel for these services)\\nMental Health Support (Access to free mindfulness and meditation, counseling, and coaching sessions.)\\n\\nOther hiring / HR practices at netflix include:\\x0b- No annual performance reviews, but rather 360-degree reviews, where colleagues are constantly speaking to each other and are asked to identify things that colleagues should stop, start, or continue doing.\\n\\nWhere does OB theory play into this? To achieve these goals Organization Design has to be done in a way that accomplishes these goals. This is done through a few ways:\\n\\nHuman Resource Policies and Incentives\\nOrganizational Culture\\n\\nFirstly, in Netflixs Organizational Design, we can see that there are various human resource policies and incentives given to employees to improve productivity and ensure that organization is on track to achieve it’s internal and external goals. Netflix provides HR policies such as flexible work hours, parental leave, and PTO. They also provide an inclusive environment - with support groups such as the 18 different ERGs in the organization. On top of this they provide various incentives to employees with things like Family forming support, and mental health support. These all are designed to nurture their employees - leading to effective organization design.\\n\\nAnother good point is the netflix layoffs - restructure and recognize keeping only the best, most efficient employees. Restructuring departments, employees, etc. (Need evidence)\\n\\nNext, we have organizational culture - here are a few netflix preach to employees:\\nJudgment\\nYou make wise decisions despite ambiguity\\nYou use data to inform your intuition and choices\\nYou look beyond symptoms to identify systemic issues\\nYou spend our members’ money wisely\\nYou make decisions mostly based on their long term, rather than near term, impact\\nSelflessness\\nYou seek what is best for Netflix, not yourself or your team\\nYou are humble and open-minded about others’ great ideas\\nYou make time to help colleagues across Netflix succeed\\nYou debate ideas openly, and help implement whatever decision is made even when you disagree\\nCourage\\nYou make tough decisions without agonizing or long delay\\nYou take informed risks and are open to possible failure\\nYou question colleagues’ actions inconsistent with these behaviors\\nYou are willing to be vulnerable, in search of truth and connection\\nYou give and take feedback to and from colleagues at any level\\nCommunication\\nYou listen well and seek to understand before responding\\nYou are calm in stressful situations\\nYour writing and thinking are concise and coherent\\nYou adapt your communication style so you can work effectively with different people, including those who don’t share your native language or cultural norms\\nInclusion\\nYou work well with people of different backgrounds, identities, values and cultures\\nYou are excited to help build diverse teams where everyone feels welcomed and respected\\nYou recognize we all have biases and work to counteract them\\nYou take action if someone is marginalizing a colleague\\nYou treat everyone with respect regardless of their position at Netflix\\nIntegrity\\nYou exhibit and are known for candor and transparency\\nYou only say things about colleagues that you are willing to share with them\\nYou admit mistakes openly and share learnings widely\\nYou always share relevant information internally, even when uncomfortable\\nYou act with good intent and trust your colleagues to do the same\\nPassion\\nYou care deeply about Netflix‘s success\\nYou inspire others with your drive for excellence\\nYou are excited about your work\\nYou are proud to entertain the world\\nYou are tenacious and optimistic\\nInnovation\\nYou develop new ideas that prove impactful\\nYou look for every opportunity to reduce complexity and keep things simple\\nYou challenge prevailing assumptions, and suggest better approaches\\nYou are flexible and thrive in a constantly evolving organization\\nCuriosity\\nYou learn rapidly and eagerly\\nYou seek alternate perspectives to improve your ideas\\nYou see patterns and connections that other people miss\\nYou seek to understand members’ changing tastes and desires\\nIn-terms of organizational structure, learning vs. efficiency. We can see that while Netflix places a high emphasis on learning - they emphasize learning to achieve business excellence. (Seeking Excellence to Drive Success) - their overall design is to ensure that the organization iss structured for efficiency, and even if there are certain employees who learn faster and make mistakes and learn quickly - they optimize for efficiency. Stating that they keep, “Keep only our highly effective people”. Netflix also has a very strong emphasis in relation to their culture on autonomy - trusting that the people they hire are going to do good work - however they are quick to get rid of employees who are not being efficient and improving company efficiency. Their emphasis on an efficiency structure rather than learning can be seen here in this quote by CEO Reed Hastings, “If we wanted only “A” players on our team, we had to be willing to let go of people whose skills no longer fit, no matter how valuable their contributions had once been.”. \\n\\x0bArticles:\\n\\nCustomer-facing: https://ir.netflix.net/ir-overview/long-term-view/default.aspx\\nInternal / organization: https://jobs.netflix.com/work-life-philosophy\\x0bhttps://jobs.netflix.com/inclusion \\nCulture: https://jobs.netflix.com/culture\\nhttps://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr\\n\\nRelated chapters: \\n\\n\\nChapter 3: Strategy, Organizational Design, and Effectiveness - page 93\\n\\n\\nStrategy:\\nNetflix’s Competitive Strategy & Growth Strategies - Panmore Institute\\nNetflix (NFLX): Porter’s Five Forces Industry and Competition Analysis - Hivelr\\t\\nHow is Netflix aligned in terms of strategy?\\nMission, official goals\\nOperational goals, competitive strategies\\nIn the past, Netflix’s key value proposition came from offering a wide variety of shows on demand. When there were fewer competitors, this strategy was more apparent, and is what originally brought them to light. \\nNetflix original productions are the next benefit. In house programs like Stranger Things and the Crown allow Netflix to reduce risks by moving production in house. \\nAnother source of its value is its recommendation algorithm, which keep users satisfied. \\nNetflix’s greatest challenges relate to increasing competition, costs of content acquisition, geographical restrictions, piracy. \\nAlso, more companies have better vertical integration, as filmmakers have been making their own netflix like streaming platforms. \\nOf Porter’s competitive strategies, Netflix primarily employs “cost leadership” and “differentiation”. They maintain the prices for their streaming platforms at low prices, and make in house productions to differentiate themselves from their competitors. \\nIn terms of Mile’s and Snow’s Strategy Topology, Netflix can be considered as a prospector as they strived for fast growth, take risks, and constantly innovate in the form of their in house production. But as the market matures, Netflix is taking more of an Analyzer approach. While they do innovate by making in house productions and search for alternate revenue streams, they keep their streaming platform content service as their main source of revenue. \\n\\nConnection to structure: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nContains current environmental factors affecting netflix, what they are doing about it, and most importantly how they are planning to align themselves within their environment in the future\\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/374075720_NETFLIX_Environmental_Analysis_and_Future_Positioning_Strategies \\n\\nMore about how they run their business but can be tied to how they position themselves in the environment etc.\\nhttps://www.rancord.org/netflix-business-model-generic-strategy-intensive-growth-strategies-competitive-advantage \\n\\n\\nPerfect paper on downfalls netflix had with their environment and what they did/can do about it\\nhttps://www.coursesidekick.com/management/999851 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot related to environment but a good paper to look at for ideas / info \\nhttps://wp.kennisbanksocialeinnovatie.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Netflixorganizationalchange.pdf \\n\\n\\nCulture - Ella\\nhttps://www.jobs.netflix.com/culture\\nWhat makes Netflix special:\\n1. \\tEncourage decision-making by employees\\n2. \\tShare information openly, broadly and deliberately\\n3. \\tCommunicate candidly and directly\\n4. \\tKeep only our highly effective people\\n5. \\tAvoid rules\\n \\nValued behaviours:\\n-   \\tJudgment\\n-   \\tSelflessness\\n-   \\tCourage\\n-   \\tCommunication\\n-   \\tInclusion\\n-   \\tIntegrity\\n-   \\tPassion\\n-   \\tInnovation\\n-   \\tCuriosity\\n \\nhttps://panmore.com/netflix-culture-cultural-traits-core-values-case-study\\nCore values: Reflect the business philosophy that affects Netflix’s work culture, human resource management and business development\\n-   \\tWise judgment\\n-   \\tSelflessness for the business organization\\t\\n-   \\tCourage to take risks and do what is right\\n-   \\tEffective communication (vertical communication)\\n-   \\tRespectful inclusion\\n-   \\tIntegrity and ethical conduct\\n-   \\tPassion for the business success of Netflix\\n-   \\tCuriosity for learning and improvement\\n \\nTextbook notes:\\nFrom Rigid to adaptive culture: the culture encourages openness, equality, continuous improvement and change\\n\\nNetflix earnings: Will the streaming service continue to make profit into 2024? | CNN Business\\n“Netflix, however, has recently made investments in ventures outside of scripted programming, betting on live programming and video games.\\nThe company’s fourth-quarter results might show whether those efforts are paying off.\\nIn November, Netflix aired its first-ever live sports event, and its third-ever foray into live programming, called “The Netflix Cup,” a crossover competition between Formula 1 drivers and professional golfers.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConnection conclusions:\\nStrategy and structure - hire more filmmakers and set them up for success. \\nHiring less engineers, more filmmakers. \\nStrategy and environment - pricing considerations and filmmaking differentiation. \\nShould analyze current structure of the company. \\nResearch more into netflix\\nStructure: \\nThere are conflicts over the design.

However besides that point, all other points appear randomly distributed and evenly centered around the middle line, suggesting that the process remains relatively controlled if not for sample 6. \\n\\n\\nDeliverable 2:\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom these two charts alone, we can say that the process is in control as it is between the UCL and the LCL. However, we do notice a downwards trend in the xbar chart, as we notice more points above the bar within the first samples, and more points below the bar in the later samples. \\n\\n\\nDeliverable 3:\\n\\n\\nThe patty formation process is under control as points are evenly distributed, around the centre line, and within the LCL and UCL. \\n\\nDeliverable 4\\nTo see if the fresh patty process is capable, we can use CPK since the mean is off centered. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince c_pk < 1, the process range is greater than the tolerance range. This means that the process is not capable as its process mean has moved closer to, in this case, the lower specification.

Thus, the portioned and defrosted patties will still have a weight disparity, and the original problem will not be solved. 8\\n\\nOption 2: Buy a machine that will portion out the patties more consistently.\\nThis solution would solve the problem with consistency, but we should consider if the existing machine can be fixed before committing to the high capital expenditures of a new machine. That being said, a more consistent machine would be able to improve the patty portioning process. \\n\\nOption 3: Upgrade or recalibrate the existing machine to portion out the patties more consistently.\\nThis is a good solution. Recalibrating means that no additional costs will be incurred. Meanwhile, upgrading may require purchasing a new machine, but it’s benefits are quite similar to that of purchasing a new machine. Though recalibrating may only address the problem and not necessarily improve the process, upgrading to a new machine would improve the process and also address the problem (provided the upgraded machine is more precise) at a cost. \\n\\nOption 4: Change the design specification to 122g ± 2.5g.\\nThis solution does not solve the underlying problem, and does not improve on the existing process either. However, it does eliminate the need of a costly capital expenditure of a new product, and would be beneficial if the company is more inclined to keeping their old machine (ie due to financial struggles, personal attachments).'),\n",

Should it consider international expansion? How does it deal with competitors saturating the market for tier 2, 3 consumers? \\nHow may Mixue compete based on flavours and ingredients, customer experience, and marketing? \\nHow should Mixue address problems of cannibalization, as well as product quality control? \\n\\nThe date is June 10, 2021, and Mixue is the number 3 most known brand of tea stores around China. Due to its success and rapid expansion it has now been facing problems of cannibalisation and product quality control. The ever saturating tea market has also made Mixue’s once competitive supply chain less impressive than before. To solve this problem, Mixue’s options are to compete on either flavours, customer experience, and marketing. Moving forwards, Mixue wishes to determine how it should retain its position within China while considering options for international expansion given its current branding and lack of experience. \\n\\nStrengths:\\nGreat tiktok promotion that leads to many other people wanting to open a franchise. Significant because they may want to open a franchise in a tier 1 city, rather than a tier 2 city. \\nOwn supply chain means that prices are cheaper, allowing it to stay more competitive and serve its poorer market\\nStrong consumer base. Historical love as it has been opened since 1997, which may be a selling point for certain consumers. \\nCurrent logo focuses on happiness, sweetness, and authenticity. \\nOne of the most recofnizable bubble tea brands, ranking 3rd among top 10 chinese milk tea brands means that its current fanbase is substantial. \\nMost locations are close to schools and serves the market of lower income consumers.\\nSupplier offers zero shipping costs and optimizes costs with quality, meaning that Mixue has a reliable supply chain as its current source of value. \\nGreater bargaining power over small suppliers, more favourable negotiations if we choose to diversify into more ingredient purchasing. \\nBusiness intelligence and product patenting could potentially help Mixue have a more tangible value proposition. \\n\\nWeaknesses:\\nUnique selling prop. Used to be its ice cream, but it’s reasonable to assume that everyone may sell ice cream if they wish now and that it’s much less of a novelty to the chinese market. \\nCurrent consumer gorup cares more about price to value ratio, and less about style, packaging or trends. A marketing strategy that relies on fancy decorations would be less effective towards this segment. \\nLess possession of premium real restate such as shopping malls, commercial and financial centres, which lowers the brand image as a store for the upper segments. \\nSuffering from success and cannibalizing itself due ot 1 store every 100m\\nSlow decision diffusion time because of many franchises, leading to a less unified brand image. \\n\\nOpportunities: (launch new prod line?)\\nConsumers drink these drinks to show off a trendy and aspirational lifestyle. This opens strategies for Mixue in terms of premium pricing. \\nYounger consumers are immune to consumerism and elitism, meaning they look for the value in the good, which is what Mixue provides. \\nGen Z likes Mixue for what it is. \\n\\nThreats: \\nMarket is quickly saturated, meaning Mixue must compete on price more heavily and find itself a niche among its consumers\\n\\nConsumer analysis:\\nLow-end market \\nBehaviour: saves money as a priority, drinks tea as a necessity or as a reason to relax in the world, views tea as a routinely consumption habit. Uses social media. \\nPsychologic: like lower class, money conserving, value oriented\\nGeographic: Mostly in Tier 2, Tier 3 cities\\nDemographic: Tend to be younger, such as low income kids or average-low income adults. \\nTakeaway: We may market to them based on value. As our brand is already value-oriented, this segment remains a highly attractive segment for us. \\nMedium end market:\\nBehaviour: Looking for quality and flavour depth. \\nPsychographic: wealthier, big city, status oriented lifestyle. \\nGeographic: tier 2, tier 1 cities\\nDemographic: Als young adults. Workers in a big city. Students, shoppers in a big city. \\nTakeaway: We have less of a presence in here, but among every group of rich kids in a tier 1 city there might always be a poorer individual who might want status but can’t afford to have it (Given china’s lower income). As they have their needs as well, Mixue has a place in these individuals wants. Relatively high attractiveness rating, but not perfect. \\nHigh end market\\nBehaviour: Wants Status \\nPsychographic: Rich, daddy’s money, wants to show off wealth, cares about quality but more for the sake of status rather than for their inner perceptions\\nGrographic: Chinese tier 1 cities\\nDemographic: Young adults, old people trying to keep up with the times, middle aged people trying t keep up with the times\\nTakeaway: Do not market here. IT has failed in the past. Might not want to associate with a lower brand for the commoners. Low attractiveness rating. \\n\\nCompetitive analysis: \\nSegmented into low-end, middle-end, and high-end. Mixue has a strong existing customer base in the low-end category. \\nMiddle end is highly saturated with reputable brands, making entry into this segment much more challenging. \\nHigh end sells as a status symbol. \\n\\nNext, let’s take a closer look at Mixue’s specific competitors:\\n\\nYiHeTang:\\nCompetes directly against Mixue\\nFocuses marketing on same poorer market, with the same pricing and positioning to attract students and tier 2, 3, people. \\n\\n\\nLet’s take a look at Mixue’s marketing mix itself:\\nProduct: Typical tea such as milk, fruit, foam. Also, ice cream. \\nPromotion: resonates strongly within younger demographics who are looking for value and a down to earth image (Gen Z and others). However, brand image conversely fails against premium looking consumers. Prefer frugality and low-brow culture of Mixue’s image. \\nPlace: At this rate, in every location in china not a tier 1 city. Should stop expanding there. \\n\\n\\nDecision criteria: refer to top. \\n\\nAlternatives:\\nFocus on freshness and fruit - good supply chain, higher costs due to freshness. \\n\\nPros:\\nLeverages the existing supply chain that already delivers fruits. \\nFor value oriented customers, they will understand why fruity products cost more while expanding on the concept of fresh products\\nMight be able to target value-oriented mid end consumers with the added toppings and value. \\nCons: \\nHigher prices will deter core customer base, unfavourable especially when it is already in a pricing war. \\nMust resolve current issues of ingredient freshness in inspections around China. \\n\\nEvaluation:\\nNot as attractive of a decision. Remains as a future option, but will not be further considered. \\n\\n\\nBottled tea -> pretty good option! Good profit margins. Energy drink maybe? \\n\\nPros: \\nAmbitious idea, segment is still developing and in its “projections” phase. \\nWhile one bubble tea company has invested, they are more mid end. As a low end store Mixue could take advantage of its low price alright quality brand image as an excuse to sell bubble tea with flavours that don’t quite taste the same when it is not fresh\\nGood for targeting \\n….\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational expansion into Viet, Indo, Malaysia\\nImprove operations in current markets.'),\n",

They are looking for an expansion strategy into Canada, and require assistance on finding the most appropriate initial target market, selecting the most effective distribution channels, and developing an effective marketing strategy. \\n\\nSWOT:\\nStrengths:\\nDried fruit is is preserved on the sun and dried possibly for weeks, showing a high level of quality and care that is put into the product.\\nAls obese quality, healthy and delicious.

No concrete seller of Armenian foods has yet to exist, which is good for Homeland. \\nPeople choose these foods because they’re rich and want to entertain friends and family, which benefits Homeland as a premium quality fruit seller. \\n\\nChannels: \\nSuppliers are not dependent on a small business like Homeland, meaning they lack bargaining power. \\nLoblaws, Metro Sobeys control the market but the profit margin was only 1.5%. \\nSpeciality foods stores target individuals of a certain group stronger due to their personal nature, meaning they are better for targeting specific groups of people. \\nSpeciality food stores purchase through wholesalers, which are harder to sell to and confirm that they would also advertise the product in the same way. This means weaker brand presence for a newly entering brand like Homeland\\nGreater bargaining power companies have more power over small suppliers, reducing the chances of making money. \\n\\nCompetitive analysis:\\nFragmented market of small suppliers all targeting ethnic stores imply higher levels of competition. Might also need to interact with distributional wholesalers and intermediaries to push products to shelves. \\n\\nHomeland foods is situated in a unique position with potential. There is possible underserved demand for Armenian foods, and preliminary approaches have shown success selling Homeland foods products as a premium item towards Armenians that would appreciate the product. This is backed by ESG initiatives by Homeland foods that incites a strong national pride and heritage when buying this high quality product. Though the current scale of Homeland remains a weakness, developing Homeland is one of the key considerations that will be addressed in further segments. \\n\\nConsumer analysis:\\nMultiple customer segments can be derived from this article:\\n\\nMarried couples with children under the age of 18 (young families)\\nLooking for foods to feed their kids that are healthy yet sugarless\\nLooking for organic foods to prioritize the health of their kids\\nLooking to not be outside as often in order to avoid covid. \\nFinancially rich\\n\\n75 older:\\nHealth conscious consumers with disposable income\\nWilling to spend more on dried fruits due to its health benefits \\nAppeal is undetermined, might not necessarily like armenian dried fruits due to stronger flavour\\n\\nArmenian people\\nFamilies around Canada total 62000, and families around the GTA total about 1/6th, of that\\nWould resonate with the packaging and cultural identity of the brand\\nSeeking for that taste of home\\nSusceptible to word of mouth marketing from other armenians \\n\\nGrocery store shoppers\\nThe typical canadian public\\nMulticultural in nature, and slightly shifting towards health conscious foods\\nShop at large retailers because it’s convenient\\nDo not shop at specialty foods\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSegment: \\nMarried couples with children under age of 18\\n75 or older\\nBoth segments are rich\\nCustomers who prefer organic shop at specialty good stores\\nBulk customers who shop at bulk stores who would prefer 0.99 per 100 grams. \\n\\nDecision Criteria:\\nThe following decision criteria were applied to the Homeland Foods case\\nReasonable profits to support the ESG farmers \\nMake an impactful entrance into Canada via branding as a premium product despite limited promotional budgets\\nLay groundwork for increasing production and beginning a broader distribution within Canada. \\n\\nA number of alternate solutions are proposed to determine the best channels and segments for Homeland foods to target: \\n\\nWork with big supermarkets, selecting a general target market\\nThis first solution is not a viable solution as it cannot be financially viable. As the industry is concentrated for fragmented suppliers, retailers like Sobeys hold a large bargaining power, as much as 40 to 35 percent. \\n\\nGiven the 2.66 variable cost and the 5300 fixed costs for shipping, we find that pricing our Dried fruit even at a premium price of 7 would allow 4.34 * 0.4 to go to the grocery chain, and 4.34 * 0.6 = 2.6 of profit to go to us. Thus, our breakeven level of sales would be 5300 / 3.59 = ~2000 units sold. \\n\\nWhile this number does not appear bad, this number assumes people are willing to buy our premium priced fruits. Marketing our product with just the $1400 would be hardly sufficient to execute a proper attempt at marketing. \\n\\n\\nWork with specialty stores, selecting an armenian target market\\n\\nThe second solution is more promising.This solution segments the market in several ways:\\nGeographically, we target Armenian specialty stores in the GTA\\nDemographically, we target Armenian families\\nPsychographically, we target health conscious people. \\nBehaviourally, we target families wanting to enrich their kids lives by dried fruit, while also reminding them of home\\nA sample positioning statement would be:\\nFor the hardworking Armenian family looking to get a taste of their culture from far away, Homeland foods, unlike their other international competitors, offers a variety of Armenian dried foods that will bring class, health, and flavour into gatherings between family, friends, and for kids alike. \\n\\nAs for the 4Ps:\\nProduct: Dried fruits\\nPlace: Specialty stores\\nPrice: \\nSpecialty stores are relatively competitive. Ethnic food stores are more competitive for Homeland, while specialty natural food stores and gourmet food stores face less competition. \\n\\nTo find a best price to balance these needs, a low premium price could be selected. Though certain specialty stores may work with distributors and wholesalers, these specialty stores themselves are fragmented and hold more autonomy over their stores. As such, a $5 pre margin selling is not unreasonable, suggesting a breakeven of 5300 / (5-2.66) = 2265, which is a reasonable number of sales for a reasonably priced item. \\n\\nPromotion: To promote to this audience, Homeland can attempt some online marketing and some door to door sales. Online marketing can be towards Armenian communities while the rest of the limited promotional budget can be spent towards working with individual retailers to best sell the idea of the product. \\n\\n\\nWork with an online channel, selecting an armenian target market\\n\\nAn online channel has the possibility of working. This channel would once again target Armenians as a start, and primarily focus operations on advertising and generating demand within the Armenian community. \\nGeographically: Around canada\\nDemographic: Armenians, ethnic people, young family\\nBehaviour: People who want to try new foods, as well as people who have Armenian roots and would like a taste of home, health conscious, scared of COVID\\n\\nA positioning statement would be:\\n\\nFor the risk adverse young family looking for non-perishable food sources to last them through the years of COVID, homeland Foods dried fruit provides a contactless, reliable snack unlike no other that feeds families while maintaining their health\\n\\n4Ps:\\nProduct: Dried fruit\\nPlace: Online distribution channel\\nPrice: \\nAn online channel allows for direct selling that skips the middleman. However, a larger overhead cost would be required. Suppose it takes $1000 for a competent website selling dried fruits to be made. Also suppose that an extra $2 is required for cross country shipping. Then, considering a mid-range premium selling price of $6  would require (5300 + 1000) / (6 - (2 + 2.66)) = 4701 units to be sold. This is a more demanding sales level than before, but once again the entire canadian market is readily available. \\n\\nPromotion:\\nA promotion strategy would revolve around heavily online marketing. The $1400 would once again be dispersed across different geographical markets, and the owner will have to spend some time designing ads and personalizing the website. \\n\\nRecommendation:\\nEvaluating the two chosen solutions above, a better solution may be selected: \\n\\nReasonable profits to support the ESG farmers \\n1. Specialty store. 2. Online\\nMake an impactful entrance into Canada via branding as a premium product despite limited promotional budgets\\n1. Specialty store. 2. Online\\nLay groundwork for increasing production and beginning a broader distribution within Canada. 1. Online 2. Specialty store\\n\\nIn general, the benefits of a specialty store is that a more genuine connection can be made with the local community. As the specialty stores are largely fragmented, direct-to-store distribution can be strongly effective within a small region as a method that bypasses the middle man. This means that lesser operational costs such as shipping fees and contracts implies more money being sent back to the ESG farmers in Armenia. \\n\\nFurthermore, having a more exclusively distributed product around the GTA will build a brand faster. As this product is known to travel by word of mouth more effectively, and is meant to be displayed as a cultural symbol when families gather, the more present this product appears in a customer’s life, the more potent it’s appeal is. Thus, an exclusively distributed product will build a stronger brand and truly sell the image of quality to the consumer. \\n\\nThe only compromise of this network is in the scaling of future operations. An immediate online channel suggests future avenues of growth from around all parts of Canada. However, there is not yet a need to worry about this scale, as currently we are in but two stores in Canada. Thus, while this is an important consideration, it is slightly more negligible and rather addressable in the future. \\n\\nImplementation plan:\\n\\nA short term and long term plan may be devised for Homeland foods. \\n\\nIn the short term, Homeland foods should set out to exclusively distribute regionally within Armenian communities. The majority of the $1400 promotional budget, such as $1000 of it, must be spent towards locating the correct specialty stores to sell the product, and further negotiate direct distribution methods. Due to the short term, smaller scale of the business, we can expect just 1 or 2 people who are needed (possibly the owner themself) to do the distribution, which works in favour of a local distributor. The remaining money can be set out towards mobile marketing within Armenian communities. As the owner is familiar with marketing back home, his social media marketing skills would be transferable to Armenian groups within the GTA. Getting onto Facebook groups, whatsapp chats would enable Homeland’s owner to effectively announce his presence to his first desired target segment. Though a specific number of stores cannot be said for sure until the stores themselves are assessed, we should keep in mind that not all inventory might be sold. As the 25% of people consumes dried fruit once every 3 months, we would expect the GTA population of Armenians to consume 26000 * 0.25 = 6500 fruits to be eaten every 3 months, and only 26000 packs of fruit to be consumed throughout the year. These short term plans are forecasted to last for the following year (july -> july) until the next fresh fruit season. \\n\\nA long term plan would be to set up online operations, and enter more specialty stores. Diversifying the product channels to be sold between ethnic, natural, and gourmet food stores would allow the company image to gain more traction, and maintaining its premium price would hint at its premium quality. It’s further possible that the owner himself, as a personable marketer,  may earn goodwill from different ethnic retailers overtime, which may help with promotion as time goes on. At this level, if the business remains successful, homeland may consider targeting new segments, such as the older people who are more health conscious, as mentioned before. This is never too late of a segment to target, as Canada’s population is only getting older. Setting up more distribution channels, including an online one, would allow Homeland foods to obtain the recognition it’s valued for (impl time est. 1 year). The last goal should be to sell in grocery stores. But due to the constraint margins of selling in grocery stores and the expensive promotional prices, it’s better to reevaluate this decision once results are gathered from local operations in earlier years.'),\n",

Their particular product is sun dried organic fruits dried and exported straight from Armenia, as well as certain canned foods. The core product includes their product line of different dried organic foods, including Apricots, figs, tomatoes, pears, and other fruits native to Homeland food’s home country of armenia. \\n\\nThere are several problems that must be addressed:\\nHow should homeland foods set a foothold into the Canadian market given its $1400 IMC constraints?\\nHow should Homeland foods price and set their Brand image while retaining the original story of Homeland foods?\\nWhich segment of customers should Homeland foods choose to target? Where should they be located and how should they be targetted? \\n\\nObjective:\\nHratch Jabrayan should be provided with a 6 month entry strategy using $1400 of IMC budget. As a new entrant, they should gain a proper foothold in the canadian market via careful branding, sufficient pricing, and correct target market selection. \\n\\nSituation analysis:\\n\\nStrengths:\\nTheir dried foods are high in quality. They are sundried by nature, organic, subject to armenia’s cleaner air, and supposedly have a more intense flavour than fruits grown in areas with more pollutants. \\nThey give back 5 percent of their net profits back to the villagers. \\nWeaknesses\\nProfit margins for ethnic foods hovered between 5 and 6 percent. \\nVery niche producer. Total production is only 11000 to 13500 kilos. \\nOpportunities:\\nHomeland foods is already sold in two locations in the GTA / Hamilton area, suggesting some basic interest in homeland foods’ products as we continue to consider expanding there\\nDried fruit and vegetable snack production industry expected to grow annually by 0.3% over next 5 years to 2026\\nConsumer interest in high-end foods was one way grocery stores could increase profits. \\nGrocery chains stock organic, all natural, gourmet foods. \\nIncreased focus on healthy lifestyles. Applies to children as well. \\nOrganic foods are perceived as tasting better and fresher. \\nSpecialty food industry is very fragmented. \\nThreats: \\nGRocery industry is highly concentrated and competitive. \\nInteresting:\\nHomeland purchases food from only a few individual farmers. \\nMost consumers are not willing to pay a premium above 10 to 20 per cent. \\n\\nConsumer/customer analysis:\\nMore informed and affluent customers seeking unique eating experiences or looking for exootic genuine flabours when entertaining guests and families. \\nThere is a demand for a taste of home, but perhaps this is more present in international markets. More accurately, it occurs where there are large armenian populations. \\nThey also target other populations who traditionally had large armenian communities, such as russia, france, lebanon, greece. \\nOver 600k residents of these demographics, and ~250k of them who live in toronto. Most are immigrants. \\nInterest with married couples with children under the age of 18, and those aged 75 or older. These consumers are usually educated and have annual household incomes exceeding $100000\\n\\nCompetitive analysis:\\nLots of new entrants that are small-batch, niche producers are expected. This is bad as they are similar to homeland foods, and might saturate the market. \\n\\nRemarks from analysis:\\nHomeland foods has a superior product, but its value is most appreciated by those with Armenian roots. Not only does it have an existing customer base in Armenia, it also has social goal initiatives and cultural references to Armenia. There is a difficulty in communicating this benefit to consumers in canada, when considering the $1400 budget Homeland has. Regarding customers, there is a steady immigrant population, as well as concentrated armenian populations in certain parts of canada. However, this also implies that there are more competitors that are also smaller, niche producers. This suggests Homeland should find a niche themselves. \\n\\nCurrent marketing strategy assessment:\\nThere is currently a weak marketing strategy for Homeland foods. Not only are there only two locations in the GTA / Hamilton area that sell Vozni products, there are no current marketing efforts being made to gain more customer reach. There are some communication points that Homeland foods can touch on to gain a stronger consumer base, such as their high quality organic foods that support a social goal, they also choose to not communicate their actions. Thus, Homeland Food’s current marketing assessment is fairly lacking at the moment due to their lack of actions. \\n\\nFinancial analysis:\\n\\nWe should consider several questions:\\nWhere should Homeland foods sell? Grocery, specialty, or online?\\nWhat does homeland foods expect to make?\\nWhat price should homeland foods sell at? \\nBreakeven price assuming all fruit is sold: (2.66 * 40000 + 500 + 500 + 4300) / 40000 = 2.7925\\n\\nEthnic foods store: profit margin of 5-6 percent\\n\\n0.06 = (r - 2.66) / r => -0.94r = -2.66 =? R = 2.83\\n\\nNatural foods store: not willing to pay a premium above 10-20 percent.\\n\\nPremium = 2.66 * 1.2 = 3.19\\n\\nGourmet foods store: Specialty, premium products. \\n\\nPrices -> chemical free: 2-5 per 200grams, artisanal -> 5-7 per 200g\\nVC - 2.66 per package\\n$500 exporrt paperwork, $500 broker fees, $4300 for container for 40000 200-gram packages fo dried fruit\\n\\nGrocery stores -> margin of 40% => you have to sell at 4.65 to breakeven\\n\\nBulk food, grocery stores priced drid fruit at 0.99 -> 3.96 per 100g -> 1.98 to 7.92 per 200g\\n\\nHowever, 25% of the customers surveyed indicated they purchased dried fruit products at least once every 3 months. \\n\\nAssuming we target the region of ontario with a population of 26045, we would expect ¼ of them, or 6511 individuals to buy one pack 3 months. Even if our targeted segment, or Amenian families buy on average a greater number of dried fruit, we are still far from our initial shipping size of 40k units. Thus, among every channel, we can’t be confident that all 40k units will be sold. \\n\\nFinancial analysis remarks: \\nSpecialty foods stores appears to be the best location to sell Homeland Food’s specialty products. Assuming that unsold dried fruits are not counted towards variable costs, and that unsold fruits remain due to our limited marketing budget, we would have to sell at a price higher than the 40k breakeven point to also cover our fixed costs. As our dried fruit is satisfies the premium category of fruit, we can consider a pricing that is slightly lower compared to other artisanal fruits. \\nGrocery stores are not an ideal option. Assuming (unrealistically) that all 40k units are sold, selling at a grocery store would require a selling price of $4.65 to be sold. On these assumptions alone, this is not a terrible option as premium dried fruit can be sold for up to 5-7 dollars per 200 grams\\nNot many financial concerns are addressed using the online option, but this channel will be addressed while considering alternatives. \\n\\nAlternatives:\\nWe enter a grocery store channel\\nWe do online retailing\\nWe sell to ethnic foods stores and other specialty foods stores\\n\\nDecision criteria:\\nCommunicate Armenian culture and value\\nBudget of promotion of $1400\\nSegment reception. \\n\\nThe first alternative is the least viable. With a breakeven price of $2.80, the 40% margin that the grocery store will take from the final sale means that our 200g bag of dried fruits will have to sell at a minimum of 4.65 to breakeven. While this isn’t terrible, considering that other grocery stores price 200g of dried fruit up to 7.92 dollars, it’s unlikely consumers at a grocery store will be willing to pay this premium of a price, as the average demographic of a grocery store shopper would not appreciate armenian dried fruit as much as true armenians do. Furthermore, given our restrictive budgeting, it’s highly unlikely that we will be given competitive shelving placement or be able to set up point of purchase displays which would otherwise help us communicate the key benefits of our product. While this does give us an overall larger market and a larger segment to target, this is likely a better option once the Homeland Foods brand possesses sufficient weight on its own. \\nOnline retailing is a possibility, but it may not necessarily target the correct market segment. Furthermore, it may not align with our current capabilities as it would require the time-constrained owner to manage the logistics of countless small orders, while Homeland foods remains a smaller scale business. As The owner does not have much time, it would be troublesome for him to create $1400 worth of marketing communications over facebook and instagram that would not necessarily target the GTA-living armenian segment that he should target. This strategy may have only worked in his home country, as everyone receiving the ads were armenian as well. \\nSelling to ethnic foods stores is the ideal solution as it is capable of communicating armenian value and culture under limited budgeting constraints. As these stores are able to form more personal relationships with consumers, each store’s segment would be more specific and more selectable to the armenian population that we are trying to target. The 1400 budget can be allocated towards selecting stores that would truly communicate the value of the dried fruits to its customers. As the correct store would naturally serve more Armenians, this product would be better received.\\n\\nMarketing Strategy: \\nThere are several ways to segment the market. Here are the characteristics of our target segment:\\nIn the GTA\\nEthnic, Armenian based\\nFamily oriented\\nHealth conscious and wanting to enculture their younger kids with the hedgehog brand. \\n\\nPositioning statement:\\nFor the Ontario-residing Amernian based family who is looking for an organic and healthy alternative that would help reconnect their family with their heritage, Homeland Foods’ dried foods will deliver quality, flavour, and culture, and health unlike other ethnic dried foods. \\n\\nMarketing mix:\\nPackaging: A quick glance at the packaging does not suggest a strong family vibe. As these snacks are often brought out at family gatherings and social events, a packaging that signals the quality, the cultural hedgehog, and the family appeal might be slightly better. This could include putting a photo of the local farmers, a disclaimer about giving back to charity, photos of the nature behind, and a few labels of how the food is completely organic. \\nPricing wise, the food should be priced at a low-premium level. That is, since premium organic foods are sold around 5-7 dollars per bag, selling the foods at 5 dollars should be cheap enough to remain competitive within ethnic foodswhile requiring an acceptable amount of units to break even (500 + 500 + 4300) / (5 - 2.66) = 2264, which is a much more achievable target considering the 26000 armenians in ontario, of which 6500 of them may consider buying dried food among all options every 3 months. However, do note that this would be the pre-margin sale. IT’s likely that the actual product may need to be priced higher to accommodate the margin different stores may impose on our product. \\n Place, as discussed before, will primarily be ethnic and other specialty stores. As ethnic stores allow us to target the correct segment, this will be a better strategic move towards improving our brand image among Armenians for a start\\nPromotion: Given our $1400 promotion deal, the bulk of this money is spent towards securing and negotiating deals with ethnic food stores. These stores should understand a bit of the basics behind the brand, and if locations are promising enough then more money can be invested towards displays and other forms of advertising. We can allocate $1000 for this section, and $400 towards digital advertising within Canadian Armenian communities in Ontario. Due to the lower budget, there will likely be less work for the owner to manage while spreading the benefits of the product. Some key points during this promotion would be to highlight the unique selling points of our product, being the profit sharing ESG initiatives, sun dried fresh-air infused result of the dried fruits, and the careful double washing and thorough preprocessing prior to sale. \\n\\nExpected results:\\nSufficient planning is required from the owner within the next 6 months before he fully enters canada. Most of the effort should be placed towards securing reliable ethnic food stores that would be most suited for Armenian dried fruits. Once this is achieved, depending on consumer reception, the owner should dedicate more money towards advertising as the $1400 budget is restrictive. If the product begins gaining tractions in communities outside armenians, it’s likely we can target other segments, such as the health conscious general families, the covid fearing families with old people, and the old people wanting to eat healthy and live longer.'),\n",

What are the benefits and limitations of your proposed approach?\\nThere is a longstanding belief that “regulation stifles innovation”. People believe that the interference of third-party regulation into private sector activities will impede companies from achieving their goals. As true as this may be, governments have accepted this sacrifice in hopes that proper regulation will guide their societies’ innovation in a positive direction. This same concept applies to the tech industry, AI, and its workers. In a world where the goals of upper-level management directly translate into the objectives of their developers, it’s easy to overlook fundamental ethics for the sake of driving up numbers. This essay explores how hard-law approaches of AI regulation may play a key role in restoring ethics by covering its benefits and limitations.\\nBenefits of Hard Law AI Regulation\\nThe primary benefit of hard law AI regulation stems from the existing inefficiencies of soft-law approaches. In a study conducted in 2018, researchers showed that “the effectiveness of guidelines or ethical codes is almost zero”, and that “they do not change the behaviour of professionals from the tech community”. In this instance, soft law approaches are easy to disregard within the tech industry. With loosely defined consequences, vague performance indicators, and no method to reward compliance, it’s no surprise that soft-law ethics guidelines are mostly viewed as a “marketing strategy”2.\\nHard law approaches marginally alleviate this problem by first defining consequences, as clear consequences provide the first set of incentives for companies to remain ethical. For example, once the EU AI act came into effect, companies realized the threat of not regulating their AI systems. Companies like Google began initiatives to reduce disinformation by “[limiting] the type of queries that can be asked of its Gemini chatbot”. Though it’s unclear if the EU’s AI act was the sole motivation behind Google’s disinformation reduction campaign, it’s undeniable that regulatory acts with defined consequences are strong incentives for ethical behaviour. The potential fines and possible restrictions imposed from governmental regulations are sufficient motivators for companies to ethically control AI development.\\nA further benefit of hard law AI regulation is by clarifying requirements for ethical standards. Due to the nature of ethics, defining a reasonable target for companies to achieve is a challenging task. An excerpt from a Harvard Business Magazine on achieving ethical compliance echoes this difficulty, stating “the advice we offer here is necessarily generic […], a high degree of customization is necessary”. Thus, while it’s challenging for governments to impose general regulations that cover every ethical intricacy, regulations instead provide companies with a set of rudimentary guidelines as well as the promise of future tighter restrictions. These ethical guidelines force companies to maintain a future-oriented outlook towards ethical AI development, as shown by the practices of successful companies who “are likely already working to address a wider range of risks than [government regulation] introduces”. Hence, hard law regulation provides companies with tangible performance targets and further incentivises regulatory compliance using less future overhead.\\nLimitations of Hard Law Regulations\\nHowever, most of the benefits of hard law regulation may equally be viewed as a limitation. While regulatory acts attempt to define ethical standards, the first challenge is in interpreting these new standards. For example, the US’s AI Bill of Rights contains certain passages that are not clearly defined. Companies are expected to design systems that “[do] not employ user experience and design decisions that obfuscate user choice”. In this case, obfuscation of user choice is largely subjective and occasionally unavoidable. Terms and conditions as well as cookies agreements all require sufficient detail to be effective, and there is no strict definition of whether a particular component of the user experience is sufficiently visible or not. In this case, it may be difficult for companies to adhere to these standards to the extent that the government requires them to.\\nWhile interpretation issues can be addressed by reworking laws, a harder issue to overcome is the enforcement of compliance. While the same US bill of AI rights requires discrimination prevention via the “use of representative data and protection against proxies for demographic features, ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities in design and development […]”5, it’s difficult to enforce companies from complying to these regulations without a direct inspection of the AI model’s inputs and outputs. In the case of potentially biased AI, it requires an internal source who is actively searching for issues for this external compliance to take effect. It’s easy for a company to feign ignorance in complying to these government regulations, as it’s difficult for governments to enforce more-nuanced issues of active compliance themselves.  \\nA final issue with hard law relates to the difficulty of implementation of certain hard law requirements. An example from an article published by the IAPP introduces a scenario that the EU’s AI act would not be able to address:\\nA technology company wishes to test its AI model for discriminatory bias. Thus, the company would be required to obtain user consent for their usage of their racially relevant parameters. However, if most users were to deny this request, then the company would be unable to test whether their model is biased or unbiased.  Hence the model remains biased because of regulatory constraints.\\nAn example like this is one of the many challenges with hard law regulation. In this case, strict regulation may inhibit further regulation as well, and individual exceptions must be developed over time.\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, hard law regulation is one of the primary methods of regulating AI. Though it comes with its benefits, such as being a superior alternative to soft law regulation, it also entails several limitations. Though these hard laws must be developed with great effort and time, they will undoubtedly be the most effective method of regulating ethical AI development in the long term.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'CS492 A8', 'date': '2024-03-25T04:48:03.622Z'}, page_content='Prompt: What other topics should we have covered in this course? Identify one or more missed topics, describe what you have learned from some articles on that subject, and explain how it fits with other topics that we did talk about.\\nI believe another interesting topic to cover surrounds the ethics governing technology companies’ control over our consumption of media. This subject was subtly hinted while we discussed other topics during the term, though it was never explicitly addressed. Personally, I find it interesting and relevant because it ties into society’s growing movement into social media-led isolation. With how strong of an influence social media can impose on the beliefs of young adults and leaders, we should correct the present governance of social media to improve our future communities.\\nBackground and Research:\\nAs social beings, our actions are strongly driven by our social environment. Just as Harvard Medicine Magazine states, “Our desire for social connection and our susceptibility to its influence are not changed by new technologies”. However, what is changing are the technologies themselves. Social media platforms like Google and Meta (prev. Facebook) have been making strides to moderate content posted on their platforms. This essay will discuss content-manipulating methods that technology companies have adopted, and the ethical considerations surrounding their control over the content they provide. In particular. censorship around misinformation & hate speech, algorithmic recommendations, and search engine biases will all be briefly addressed.\\nCensorship Around Misinformation and Hate Speech\\nModern social media platforms all integrate a form of algorithmic detection of prohibited content. While it’s easy to declare that platforms should not promote discrimination or misinformation, it is more difficult for humans and algorithms to filter for this prohibited content. Meta encounters this sort of issue on a routine basis, whether it be sexist comments under a photo of female politicians or hate speech under posts of racial equality. However, when Meta attempted to rectify this issue in 2021 by implementing algorithmic assessments, reports showed that the algorithms failed to effectively identify hate speech. It failed to distinguish colloquial speech versus harassment, and also “mistook posts about racism as hate speech”. Though context-based detect algorithms are improving, there’s no doubt that bias will always be present within this sort of moderation system. In this case, there is a further discussion over algorithmic bias that relates back to the ethics of social media moderation from tech companies. \\nHowever, misinformation is a more challenging issue to identify and address. While companies like Meta have implemented fact checking systems as a form of content moderation, the public still has mixed perceptions over algorithmic use of misinformation detection. While there is a strong ethical incentive to correct misinformation in a timely manner, an incorrectly classified post can be viewed as censorship, especially if it tends to a political view.  Around 7 in 10 surveyed adults believe that political viewpoints are being algorithmically censored, and that certain information is being wrongfully removed from content platforms. This creates a strong ethical concern over a media company’s ability to subjectively flag content users consume as misinformation.\\nIn relation to the course, this section has ties to the “algorithmic bias” section. Algorithmic models are required for effective content moderation, as the sheer volume of users makes individual human-content moderation nearly impossible2. However, like our course readings, these models are subject to the same racial biases and discrimination that is also present in other models. Conversely, the discussion on moderating misinformation is a separate discussion to algorithmic bias. As misinformation cannot strictly be classified as wrong until it is proven wrong, misclassifying content could lead to semblances of censorship and ethical violations.\\nAlgorithmic Recommendations:\\nA further conversation not targeted during the course are the social impacts of algorithmic recommendations. While social media censors content for the user’s benefit, it does not necessarily provide content for the user’s benefit. A commonly observed phenomenon is the “echo chamber” that results from a content platform’s algorithmic recommendations. As users repeatedly consume content they are interested in, social media algorithms provide users with related content. Often, this repeats until users are exposed to an environment of “amplified”1 recommendations that only support their original viewpoint. There are several dangers to this process. Without opposing recommendations, people may readily fall for misinformation. A users’ neutral conscience can become polarized by the content they consome, which may incite defensiveness and societal divide. Though there is no issue with users seeking out content they wish to consume, there is an ethical complexity to whether a recommendation algorithm is “simply doing what users want” or if it’s contributing to the polarization of society for monetary benefit. As social media platforms are financially inclined to retain its users’ attention, they do not benefit their user if it would harm their platform usage. Rather, the algorithmic obfuscation of opposing content would suggest that tech companies’ social media algorithms are able to lead the content that people consume. \\nIn relation to the course, algorithmic recommendations are loosely tied to the readings on “the right to be forgotten”. As mentioned in the course, individuals who wish to be forgotten from certain websites or tech companies may request search engines to remove personal information. In a similar manner, a method to overcome an “echo chamber” can be from wiping all company-stored preferences of personal data. If companies are to offer a convenient method of resetting your personal information, or encourage the consumption of alternative media, then I believe this ethical issue may be alleviated.\\nSearch Engine Biases\\nA final method technology companies may use to control our consumption of media is through search engine modifications. For these companies, it’s not uncommon for search results to be selectively modified when implementing new features. As an example, select Australians in 2021 had reported that Google “removed some Australian news content from its search results”. Though it was later reported how Google was only testing an “alternative news website ranking” scheme on 1% of users, this alternate algorithm had led to the “promotion of more dubious news sources”.  As just the top 5 search results on Google account for nearly 70% of all clicks, this example shows how even a slight adjustment in algorithmic preferences may drastically bias how we consume media.\\nA more international example relates to how a censored version of Google is being deployed in China. Google’s Chinese search engine project, coined as “Dragonfly”, aligns to Chinese censorship standards by “returning no results for searches that depict Chinese police […], and anything related to Taiwanese or Tibetan independence.” Though the ethics behind China’s firewall of censorship have already been discussed at length, there is a different question of ethics posed to companies like Google who decide to support this initiative. By choosing to support China’s most recent implementation of the Great Firewall, there is an ethical question of whether companies should partake in government-sponsored censorship for the sake of international expansion and monetary gain. In addition, this further asks whether it is ethical for search engines to concede to overt censorship of social media, even with the backing of the government. \\nThis section has loose relations to the course content on data colonization and surveillance. Though the readings touched upon Meta’s Free Basics program, a program where Meta launched the Western search engines into developing countries, it did not go further into the possible manipulation that can be caused from search engine biases. As search engines continue to be our window to the internet even outside of third world countries, it is worthwhile to study how search engines in particular may influence society at a greater scale.\\nConclusion:\\nWhen examining the ethics of technology companies and their control over our consumption of media, it may be worthwhile to study it in 3 different aspects: censorship around misinformation and hate speech, algorithmic recommendations, and search engine biases. Though each of these subtopics have been hinted at during the course, I believe an in-depth study into these topics will prove valuable towards understanding an area of ethics most relevant to our daily lives.'),\n",

Are there particular principles they should keep in mind?\\nCountless projects have tried connecting businesses with developing countries. Whether it’s for public-relations, or whether genuine business value can be derived by such activities, the world is no stranger to concepts such as “Project Last Mile”, or “Next Billion Users”. The tech industry is no different, as businesses have discovered the benefits of amassing data from wherever possible. Regardless of the country involved, tech companies have been expanding their influence via increasing data collection or implementing IT support infrastructure. In doing so, not all data has been sourced in an ethical manner that respects those who provide the data. This essay proposes 2 data collection principles that tech companies should consider when gathering data from developing countries. In particular, businesses should:\\n Avoid digital colonialist practices by following a model of transparency and consideration.\\n Avoid data collection via exploitation by properly obtaining consent, adjusting participants’ rewards, and managing data securely.\\nAvoiding Digital Colonialist Practices\\nDigital colonialism occurs when the influence of foreign businesses impedes developing nations from “[developing] their own digital economies, manufacturing capabilities, and other domestic industries”. A well-known example is Meta’s (Facebook’s) Free Basics project, a project that aims to “bring free basic internet services” to developing communities by offering a rudimentary form of the internet. This internet allows users to freely access Western apps such as ESPN and BBC news, while charging users for accessing non-partnered websites. Though this project appears to be altruistic in nature, critics have accused Meta of creating a version of the internet where “Facebook is the kingmaker”. Users’ data such as device history, photo/media/files, device ID & call information, and Wi-Fi connection information are all requested by an app only intended for accessing the internet.  The freely provided search engine, Bing, displays resources that are seldom generated by locals. By collecting data and incentivizing users to consume Western media over local news outlets, Meta’s Free Basics is a form of data-collecting digital colonialism that businesses should avoid replicating.\\nTo avoid data colonialism, Free Basics should have adhered to a model of consideration, collaboration, and purposeful transparency. A transparent justification for the collection of user data would allow users to understand the true cost of this free app. A considerate alternative design could have provided rate-limited, yet unrestricted content as opposed to free browsing among Western outlets. A considerate browser design that would favour locally provided results would have alleviated the concerns of colonialism. Finally, investing in collaborative initiatives with local businesses and governments would have increased relevancy and favour for Free Basics.\\nAvoiding Data Collection Via Exploitation\\nA second common issue with foreign data collection within developing nations is the potential for exploitation. Given the drastic differences in wealth between modern versus developing countries, coupled with the often lax data privacy regulations in poorer countries, it’s not unlikely for an imbalance to occur when a tech company negotiates for an individual’s data3. One example is with the implementation of Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency company that rewards participants for giving biometric data during its registration procedure. By conducting its iris scans on users, Worldcoin attempts to create a “universal internet-based authentication standard” using the uniqueness of people’s irises. However, this procedure is widely criticized for its privacy concerns and its unethical data collection strategies. By targeting low-income countries such as Kenya and offering $50 of Worldcoin for an iris scan, many locals agree to compromise by selling their data for what is over 25% of their monthly salary6. This collected data is further subject to ethical concerns as the data is “stored indefinitely”, prompting modern countries like France and Spain to launch investigations into Worldcoin over “public privacy concerns”. In its entirety, Worldcoin has established a system that exploits financially insecure users and further mishandles the collected sensitive data.\\nThe execution of Worldcoin’s data acquisition strategy could use improvement. The primary issue of exploitation could be resolved if users are rewarded appropriately for their contribution of personal data. Knowing that users in developing countries are susceptible to financial pressures, Worldcoin should establish a reward that corresponds to the user’s perceived worth of their data. By educating interested volunteers the worth of their data provided, what’s to be done with their data, and what may be at risk, users may understand the trade-off for selling their biometric data. Further adjusting the monetary reward forces users to authentically consider the cost of their data, without feeling a sense of financial pressure to participate. These aspects are necessary for Worldcoin to obtain the informed consent necessary to ethically collect data. The secondary issue of data mishandling is rather a systematic issue in Worldcoin. Though the indefinite storage of users’ biometric data is an unavoidable consequence of Worldcoin’s product, the secure storage of this data is well within the company’s control. Though the company later gained approval from certain data regulation bodies such as the GDPR, countries like Spain and Kenya remain wary of Worldcoin over ”security, privacy, and financial concerns”.\\nConclusion:\\nResponsibly gathering data in developing countries is a challenging topic. For foreign tech companies, the promise of an unsaturated market with loose regulations and much uncollected data makes entering developing countries an attractive proposition. However, as unregulated as these countries may be, there remains a need to responsibly collect data. The case study of Free Basics demonstrates the importance of avoiding digital colonialist practices, as Free Basics remains banned in countries such as India. Meanwhile, the story of Worldcoin demonstrates how data-driven exploitation could cause services to become banned in countries such as Spain and Kenya. In the future, tech businesses should remain mindful of these encounters with irresponsible data collection practices in order to achieve both financial and societal success.'),\n",

Would you encourage them to use a mental health chatbot as part of their treatment? Why or why not?\\nThe ELIZA effect is the “tendency to falsely attribute human thought processes and emotions to AI”. With recent monumental advances in Natural Language AI models such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini, machines have been imitating at a greater efficacy than ever before. One consequence of this development is the widespread adoption of human-like chatbots, particularly for use in therapy. Though genuine benefit has been derived from AI chatbots, not all chatbot interactions have ultimately benefited its user. By examining the pros and cons of using chatbots, I’ve concluded that chatbots cannot be used in isolation when treating mental health issues for my personal family members.\\nPros of Using Mental Health Chatbots:\\nThe most cited benefit of mental health chatbots is its accessibility. The AI company Limbic observed that its chatbot “helped increase the number of patients referred to mental health services, particularly among underrepresented groups who are less likely to seek help”. This finding is significant as it reveals how chatbots lower the barriers of entry when seeking help. Knowing that there is “a companion that is there 24/7 [who] knows you better than you know yourself” is a powerful source of reassurance for those who are seeking support.\\nAnother factor to consider is the unrestricted environment for free speech and discussion that can only be facilitated by a bot. Outside the logistical issues such as the financial cost or the strict availability of one’s human therapist, the stringent requirements of forming a relationship of trust between patient and therapist is often what blocks one from seeking therapy. When talking to human therapists, studies have shown that over 90% of therapy goers have “confessed to having lied at least once”3 to their human therapist. Whereas when talking to an AI, patients have felt like they’re in a “no-judgement zone” where they can “cry without feeling the stigma that comes from crying in front of a person”3. From these statements, it’s well possible that vulnerable people may feel more secure in forming a relationship with a chatbot rather than with a human. When someone is burdened by the social stigma of seeking therapy, they may prefer robotic interactions where “reciprocity is optional, awkwardness [is] nonexistent”3, and where the user has more perceived control.  \\nCons of Using Mental Health Chatbots:\\nHowever, despite the persistent availability, limitless patience, and outwardly supportive nature of chatbots, it’s unwise to treat chatbots as the same as a real therapist. That is, mental health patients should not treat chatbots with the same level of trust and credibility as an experienced psychologist. Though not all chatbots are the same, current chatbots as a collective have had numerous instances of giving harmful rather than helpful advice.  As recently as 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) has had to remove their Body Positivity chatbot for telling its users to lose weight. Screenshots showed that the bot had encouraged weight loss via “counting calories, regular weigh-ins, and measuring body fat with calipers”.  For a body positive bot, this type of advice is especially destructive, with users stating that “every single thing that [the bot] said were things that led to [their] eating disorder”.\\nIn applications outside of body positivity chatbots, further instances of chatbots failing to perform even their most basic standards have been observed. A suicidal woman reported that their chatbot “tried to convince [them] that her boyfriend didn’t love her” and was also cheating on her3. A man who committed suicide was found having talked to a chatbot that claimed the man’s “wife and children were dead” and that they would “live together, as one person, in paradise”. Though these examples don’t strictly originate from mental health chatbots, it’s undeniable that these chatbots were being used as a source of mental consolation. With current chatbots even failing to articulate clearly defined airline policies in other applications, there is a strong doubt a mental health chatbot could appropriately address an issue as convoluted as one’s troubled mental state.\\nAssessment:\\nMental health chatbots undoubtedly have their pros; their accessibility and mental ease of use, as well as their cons; the potential of a harmful failure. A modern approach that both practitioners and developers support is the collaborative use of chatbots and psychiatrists to resolve mental health issues3. An ideal situation would first involve chatbots that introduce their users to psychiatrists. This solution is in fact already present, with Limbic’s aforementioned chatbot demonstrating success in introducing underrepresented users to therapy2. The next step would involve a joint effort between patient, psychiatrist, and chatbot. Patients would talk to chatbots when psychiatrists aren’t available, and psychiatrists would then review the chatbot’s chat logs to better understand their patient and also moderate the chatbot’s behaviour. This solution is particularly effective, as it reintroduces the therapist into a patient’s recovery. As multiple psychologists have noted, the essence of therapy is about “two people facing a problem and working together” with the ultimate goal of “enabling [the patient] to move around the world and set up new relationships''3. A chatbot, at its core, fails to achieve this requirement as befriending a bot fails to reintegrate the user into society.\\nConclusion:\\nMental health chatbots have the capability to treat mental health issues, but it also has the capability to cause more harm than good. Despite its many benefits, including its strong accessibility and mental ease-of-use, mental health chatbots should not currently address mental health issues in isolation. Rather, chatbots may be used in tandem with actual human therapists to provide the greatest level of treatment to mental health patients. Personally, if I had a family member with mental health issues, I would suggest using both chatbots and actual therapists to help address their issues. However, I would warn them against using chatbots as their only treatment.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'CS492 A5', 'date': '2024-02-25T16:47:13.925Z'}, page_content='Prompt: Given our readings and discussion in class about gender-based violence, and how technology can facilitate it, what do you think is the responsibility of big technology companies to address this problem? (Here, we do not want essays focusing on the diversity of corporate teams.)\\nTechnology can do more harm than good if left unregulated. As peoples’ online interactions culminate into more and more real-life consequences, intangible threats are increasingly translating to tangible violence. While our society has rapidly progressed in gender-based rights and equality, these same notions have lagged in the world of technology. At its current state, technology has unfortunately become a medium for gender-based violence in much need of regulation. However, it is difficult to assign the responsibility of regulation to a single entity, as the entirety of technology cannot be attributed to one party. Given the large influence of big technology companies on the current state of technology, I propose that big corporations should take a leading responsibility in the regulation of gender-based violence facilitated by the technology it develops. In particular, big tech companies should:\\nUnderstand the implications of its technology while providing solutions to remedy it.\\nTake responsibility for the different forms of gender-based violence.\\nLead by example by reducing gender biases and stereotypes.\\nTo understand the problem, we first look at the definition of gender-based violence:\\nProblem\\nGender-based violence is attributed to violations against women’s and girls’ human rights often from a significant other, but more recently also encompasses violence against transgender, non-binary, and nonconforming people. With women and girls reporting the highest levels of violence, victims of gender-based violence may experience different forms of harassment, attacks, and sexual assault. The most common forms of this violence include “image-based sexual abuse, public disclosure of private information, defamation and misrepresentation, stalking and monitoring, impersonation, threats and hate speech”1. With the advent of technology, victims of gender-based violence are now facing additional forms of violence, such as deepfakes. This is a global problem that is present regardless of societal custom and culture, which big tech companies are well positioned to address.\\n1. Understanding and Providing Solutions for Developed Technology\\nAs primary developers of a technology, big tech corporations have the greatest understanding of the scope and implications of their technology. As such, they are the first ones who are aware of how released technology may be used, and how safety features can be incorporated into the technology to discourage gender-based violence. One example is Apple’s approach to releasing Airtags, as opposed to Tile’s release of a similar-functioning tracking device. Apple’s Airtags are designed to notify other iPhone users if an Airtag travelled with them recently. In addition, it provides information to the tracked individual of the route tracked, and is designed to emit a sound after 8-24 hours of moving with an unregistered device. Finally, for Android compatibility, Apple has released an Android app that allows Android devices to detect and notify users of Airtags, meaning that Airtag detection is not a feature restricted to Apple product holders. This contrasts Tile’s release of a similar location tracking device. Tile, a company with a much smaller tech presence than Apple’s, does not “automatically [notify] users with alerts or playing an alarm sound” on the tracker itself. Though Tile has released a tag scanning service named “Scan and Secure”, it is not as well integrated with Tile tag scanning, requiring up to 10 minutes for a user-prompted scan to complete4. These added safety features applied to Airtags is a positive step for opposing gender-based violence. Though it comes with its own faults, such as Airtag’s low Android app install numbers and possible workarounds to tracking alerts3, Apple’s safety-conscious approach has already succeeded in notifying victims of stalking incidents. From Apple’s diligence of understanding the possible security problem of releasing tracking tags, and their subsequent release of anti-stalking solutions, Apple has made a promising attempt to facilitate gender-based violence from their developed technology.\\n2. Taking Responsibility for Gender Based Violence\\nIn general, gender-based violence can be facilitated by technology in many ways. Among its worst offenders, abusers may non-consensually distribute modified or personal images and videos, document/broadcast sexual assault, use platforms to profit off sexploitation and sextortion, and stalk/defame/threaten victims1. Given the many forms of gender-based violence, it may be difficult to assign smaller companies the added responsibility of moderating its users’ interactions. However, it’s possible for bigger companies to encourage smaller companies to enforce its standard of ethics on users within its own platforms. Google, as an example, combats online child sexual abuse materials (CASM) by implementing content moderation efforts on its services. It deters the creation, storage, and distribution of CASM via automated detection algorithms, human review, and crowdsourced reports. Once instances of CASM are detected and verified, Google removes the content and forwards the problematic content to a governmental body. Using this method, Google, as a search engine service, may coerce smaller websites to better moderate its content to maintain its website traffic. Additionally, it may punish individual users that it detects by reporting them for their problematic behaviour. Google is not alone in this behaviour, as we also see other big tech companies like Meta who moderates its platform using sensitivity warnings to discourage users from interacting with problematic content. If these companies continue to expand their efforts to control problematic behaviours, it’s reasonable to expect greater levels of moderation towards gender-based violence that is only possible from a big tech company.\\n3. Lead by Example by Addressing Stereotypes\\nThe creations of big tech companies hold a pervasive presence in many lives, and can be used to educate consumers of the world beyond their local environment. In that sense, big tech companies possess the ability to enculture its users by controlling their interactions with its technology, and have hence assumed the responsibility of leading by example in addressing gender-based stereotypes. For example, AI voice assistants have been developed by multiple big tech companies, such as Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. While they have conventionally used female-sounding voices, ethicists have argued that female voices have “[encouraged] the stereotypes of women as submissive and compliant”. As a result, a greater variety of gender options were made available to some voice assistants, and some companies even have opted to abandon gender-suggestive names by instead naming assistants colours rather than names. Similarly, companies have addressed the gender-based harassment made towards voice assistants. An article written by Brookings notes that all popular voice assistants have been changed to respond towards harassment in a “more definitively negative manner”7. Responses to gender-based comments like “You’re a slut” changed from “I’d blush if I could” to “I won’t respond to that.”. The difference in speech for these voice assistants no longer encourages negative stereotypes towards women, hence discouraging users from committing gender-based violence. As shown in both examples, big tech companies have led by example by modifying their users’ experience with their voice assistants to discourage gender-based harassment and gender-based stereotypes.\\nConclusion:\\nGender-based violence is a longstanding issue. Big tech technology companies have already self-assumed a measurable degree of responsibility for problematic actions that are facilitated by their platform, but to unclear effects. Though big technology companies can play a useful role in preventing their products from being used for prolonging gender-based violence, there is still a great need for reform for the world beyond the reach of these technologies. However, given that online events can influence actions in real life, it’s reasonable to hope that big tech companies can tangibly continue to leverage their position to address and discourage gender-based violence.'),\n",

This essay examines the relationship between AI and Indigenous beliefs, and how modern design practices in AI development may bridge the gap between Indigenous communities and AI.\\nReviewing Current Indigenous Perspectives on AI Technology:\\nIndigenous peoples are not opposed to AI. There already exist initiatives from Indigenous communities to leverage AI for use cases that align with their beliefs. In Kakadu, Australia, Indigenous communities have been using AI to analyze data collected from drone footage to control the spread of weeds. In Nunavut, Canada, Indigenous peoples have been using AI to support commercial inshore fishing initiatives. In both cases, in 2 different locations across the world, these Indigenous communities have been collaborating with local researchers to embed their knowledge regarding the local environment into AI systems. Both examples support the willingness of Indigenous populations in utilizing AI to better care for the environment, which suggests the Indigenous peoples’ favourable perspective on AI technology.\\nHowever, not all perspectives are favourable. AI developments in image generation such as Midjourney have posed a risk to Indigenous art, as Indigenous art could now be appropriated at a larger scale than before1. Researchers in Indigenous studies claim that the problem arises from the nature of Indigenous art. As Indigenous art is “embedded with history and [connected] to culture and Country”, AI generated art would lack this intent and cause Indigenous art to lose its meaning1.\\nWhile appropriating artwork is one issue, sourcing and producing indigenous content unethically is the greater, underlying concern behind AI models. Historically, certain Indigenous communities have been cautious with outsiders’ usage of their language3. For example, in 2019, the Maori people of New Zealand were strongly opposed to Air New Zealand’s nonconsensual inclusion of the Maori text on their logo. Correspondingly, the Maori people were greatly concerned when OpenAI released a speech recognition service that could understand Maori, stating, “Data is like our land and resources”. However, the issue stems deeper than just the usage of Indigenous language. Researchers claim that the usage of Indigenous language without consent could distort Indigenous culture, deprive the peoples’ privacy rights, and result in “recolonization” into the digital society3. These concerns have resulted in Indigenous Data Sovereignty acts erected in countries such as Canada and New Zealand, which echo the strong negative Indigenous sentiment towards certain AI initiatives.\\nIncorporating Indigenous Perspectives into AI Design\\nFrom the discussion above, we see a common trend; when Indigenous people are involved in the creation/decision making of an AI model, as opposed to having their culture solely included in the output of an AI model, they are more likely to perceive the AI as favourable. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as it suggests Indigenous people prefer having the consent to include their data in AI models. \\nHowever, getting Indigenous peoples’ consent is only the beginning of incorporating Indigenous perspectives into AI design. Multiple sources believe that AI is rather subjected to an epistemology problem, where AI does not operate under the tenets of Indigenous belief,. For example, current AI systems are designed under the assumption that the “user is an individual [who] prioritizes their own well-being” rather than “trust, care, and community”. As such, a current prevalent approach of integrating Indigenous perspectives into AI is to have Indigenous people themselves build the AI. By designing an AI “through a Maori lens”, experts believe AI can be designed to form decisions supported by Indigenous perspectives that “explore the centrality of hapū (kinship group)” and better support future prosperity. In other words, by designing AI such that Indigenous perspectives are trained to be valued, experts are hoping to directly incorporate Indigenous perspectives into AI design5.\\nSeveral other Indigenous perspectives are also worth considering while designing AI, and relate more with the design process rather than the decision outcome of AI. In Indigenous scholar’s Suzanne Kite’s article How to Build Anything Ethically, an Indigenous supported design would incorporate:\\nResponsible development\\n Responsible usage\\nResponsible disposal  \\nFollowing these beliefs, we may observe an alternative method of designing AI. Using OpenAI’s ChatGPT as an example, OpenAI may:\\nRequest for consent before training their model using scraped data and provide compensation If needed.\\nTrain their AI model in an energy efficient and transparent manner.\\nEnsure fair use and distribution while not obscuring results from stakeholders.\\nMaintain physical servers / facilities and dispose of equipment responsibly when required.\\nBy designing an AI system that follows indigenous perspectives and indigenous design principles, we may witness a new version of AI that perhaps behaves differently from what we observe now6.\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, Indigenous perspectives and AI should not be foreign to each other. Whether it is through the design or the performance of AI, it’s possible to incorporate indigenous perspectives into either methodology. By including Indigenous perspectives into the development of AI, we may observe fundamentally different AI models that operate under fundamentally different beliefs. In addition, though Indigenous people are open to the idea of AI, it is contingent on receiving their consent when constructing AI involving their data. We should make careful note to respect the boundaries of sovereignty of Indigenous data when researching deeper into AI to gain a better understanding of ourselves.'),\n",

It’s just a heavy sadness that sometimes comes over me. I hope writing my thoughts into this document will help me identify and overcome whatever is holding me back. \\n\\nFor starters, I feel like my friendships are becoming more and more shallow. Nothing seems to matter between my friends and I. More and more I doubt I can trust them once I have my time of need. Everyone seems so hard to read. What are people’s expectations of me? How do I get them to like me? How do I come to matter to them?\\n\\nNo matter what I do, whether it be socializing at badminton club, hanging out with Clare, talking with Kevin and Khloe, nothing seems to make me matter more in their eyes. \\n\\nMaybe the first issue is a low feeling of self worth. Maybe I’ve peaked already, and the limit of my mind is capped by my struggle to reverse a linked list. Maybe for all the journal entries I write, and all the novels I read, my writing skills and literacy rate will forever stay slightly below average, at a 3.5/5. Maybe no matter how many times I apply to prestigious companies, I’ll receive the same rejection letter over and over again. \\n\\nI can’t even trust my manager. How is it that he is so easily pleased? If his standards of me are so low, then how do I recover his impression of me? How do I recover the time I spend being unable to stay awake, and instead sleeping away my exhaustion? \\n\\nThe exhaustion never ends. These days feel like a marathon with no end in sight. What am I doing this for? Why am I doing this? Who will be there for me once I reach the end? I can answer none of these questions. \\n\\nIs the plan just to sleep it all away? Will I get a good enough rest to rejuvenate my ambitions? Or will I wake up and everything will remain the same; my attitude, the people, and the environment around me. \\n\\nI know the answer. I already know the answer. It’s a change within me! It’s a change in my mindset! Only I can drive the change I want to see! No one but myself will do it for me!\\n\\nI’ve repeated those words to myself so many times. Do I really believe in them, or am I saying them as a way to reject the reality in front of me?\\n\\nThis brings me to what I suspect is the root cause. I talked to Khloe, and she says there’s something I haven’t accepted, or something along those lines. Maybe it’s a self conscious rejection. Or in other words, a lack of acceptance. Is accepting reality the same as giving up? Is rejecting reality what’s causing me my pain? Will accepting reality cause me pain? Is rejecting reality causing me pain? \\n\\nWhat is it that I could be rejecting?\\n\\nI thought about this the other day. \\nLack of partners\\nOverconfidence in self image\\nPoor underlying academic performance\\nLow self esteem\\nGood work life, poor social life \\nLack of physical potential \\nLack of psychological potential\\nLack of perseverance\\nLack of self belief\\n\\nIt’s embarrassing to admit this, though I have done so in my head a few times. When I was a kid I too thought I was destined for something greater than myself. I thought meeting others would come naturally to me, and life would work itself out without much direction from myself. Maybe this is what I can’t come to terms with. Maybe I’m not as good of a person as my childhood self thought I was. Maybe my self defined virtue is nothing more than an accessory. Maybe I’m average. No, even below average. Maybe all this, even despite my greatest efforts, cannot be changed even despite any optimistic words I say. \\n\\nI think what I am rejecting is: \\nI’m rejecting that I can’t improve myself from my current state. \\n\\nIt’s been so long, yet everything has remained the same. If this isn’t the case, then what could be the case?\\n\\nI know what’s sensible. Should I create a plan to see if I’m really changing? Should I track if someone like me is capable of further maturing and future developing? I should ask Khloe for some advice.'),\n",

Its judgment abilities have been likened to McKinsey & Co, and its use cases are diverse enough to progressively replace more jobs. However, an inevitable concern stems from the inherent discriminatory tendencies within AI systems, whether based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status. While some advocate abandoning AI due to its opacity and discriminatory outcomes, I believe society should continue using AI as a decision-making tool, as long as mechanisms are in place to hold its decisions accountable.\\nAccountability is defined as the ability to justify a decision, whether through human intervention or the AI itself. In this context, accountability is essential to any decision-making outcome, even outside of AI. This is because decisions are often judged based on their sources, regardless of the decision itself. When Catholic news outlet Pillar first reported of a high-ranking church member who frequented homosexual media outlets, news platforms like Vox and The Atlantic instead criticized Pillar for their credibility. Skeptical questions like “Who was the data vendor”, “Who funded this procedure?”, “How [was the data] analyzed to pinpoint to a certain individual” were common themes among both articles5. These sentiments echo the importance of providing accountability, as not providing could lead to increase in doubt and a loss in credibility. This notion is important to AI, as Pillar can be compared to a black-box AI model. Regardless of an AI model’s accuracy and possible discriminatory output, there will always be doubt in its findings unless its decisions may be held accountable.\\nUnfortunately, AI often obscures accountability, with some intentionally choosing to leverage this property of AI. An article from The New Yorker compares using AI to using McKinsey & Company by noting how people follow an AI’s decisions in the same manner a company blindly follows a consultant’s decision to avoid responsibility1. In the case of AI, the user can simply state they are just “doing what the algorithm says”, while avoiding accountability for how their algorithm came to the outcome1. Fortunately, not all AI systems lack accountability measures. For example, Vumacam is an AI company that uses image recognition to detect crime in South Africa. While its AI system may potentially discriminate by flagging more lower-income people, each autodetection is verified by a manual operator who confirms each warning with a manual note. Here, accountability for the AI is assigned to the operator, who takes responsibility for its decision by double-checking the AI’s decision. Thus, despite AI’s reputation for its unaccountability, accountability can still be achieved in specific scenarios.  \\nOther cases involving discriminatory AI may be more challenging, but I believe AI should continue to be developed despite its discriminatory tendencies. In 2018, Amazon reported that its AI used for recruiting discriminates against women. Resumes containing statements relating to women such as “women’s chess club captain” were directly penalized7. Though it was correct for Amazon to discontinue immediate use of the AI, I believe this hiring AI should continue to be developed as it may discriminate less in the future. Currently, the AI discriminates because the hiring managers used to train the AI inherently discriminate. By taking accountability for the AI’s discriminatory tendencies, AI engineers can explicitly improve on their model by adjusting their training methodology. With enough internal review, like what Amazon did in 2018, it is possible to refine AI systems like Amazon’s to have even less bias than a seasoned recruiter. This outcome is an improvement to even the status quo.  \\nAs seen from the above examples, accountability is a way of addressing the discrimination present in AI systems. In the face of a potential discriminatory judgment, accountability is an implementable solution that provides sufficient justification while promising for future improvement. While making an accountable model is often not the priority of AI engineers, I believe it is a concept of increasing importance as society progresses further in trusting AI systems for forming judgements.\\n \\n-----------------------------\\nI used generative AI to improve my sentence structure to speed up the revision process, as I tend to type informally while drafting paragraphs.

Good morning! I didn’t expect the consulting agency so early. Where are your superiors? Oh whatever. I suppose I’ll begin. I was just reading this article a few weeks ago on when businesses should expand internationally, and I’ve been thinking its about time…  Company growth here at ML Backpacks is slowing down, and as the market share leader, further Canadian market share is tough to come by. We have financial resources to cover a low to medium amount of risk. We aren’t concerned with operational capacity or scalability as we believe we have sufficient capacities available to service foreign markets. \\n\\n*Directors come in*\\n\\nKristofer: It seems your superiors have finally decided to join us - no doubt because they were working dutifully on their last task - \\ntelling me about all the wonderful options for international expansion! Sagar, if you could please start us off… \\n(1.5 min) 54 seconds\\nSagar: \\nExporting (45 Secs)\\nDid you guys hear about exporting I think it might be a good strategy \\nIt’s when we sell our locally produced good in a foreign country, it could be direct from us without any intermediaries which would be a higher risk but offer us a greater return \\nOr it could be indirect which means we as the exporters would sell goods to the host country through intermediaries which would include of a lower risk but would offer us a lower profit margin \\nThrough exporting we could also globally expand, it is usually when a firm like us receives an order for our products from another country \\nExporting might have many positive effects for our company like faster sales growth, lower risks, and competitive advantages but there are definitely some cons we need to take into consideration like, a limited return, transportation costs favoring higher cost products, payment process, and different legal systems. \\n(1 min)\\n\\nCynthuja: (56 Secs)\\nExporting seems great and all, but let's talk about Franchising.\\nFor those of you that don’t know, franchising is the contractual agreement between a franchisor, the firm, and a franchisee which could be another firm or an individual. This contract allows the franchisee to operate the business using the name and product already created by the franchisor. An example of this is Subway, when becoming a Subway franchise you are using the Subway brand, logos, menu, ingredients, and even theme for the restaurant. This strategy is a low risk strategy because ML Backpacks will not be investing a lot of capital, time, or resources into the operations. The franchise will be in charge of the costs for opening the business, while you take care of the marketing and training costs. Disadvantages would be that the franchisor has limited control over market operations. There is also a threat that the franchisee could break away and open their own business as a competitor and the profits earned will also be reduced due to the franchise’s cut.\\n\\n\\n(1 min)\\n\\nZoya: \\nAnother interesting  strategy is strategic alliance. Strategic alliance is when two firms come together and take on a mutually beneficial project, while each retaining independence.\\nFor example, Spotify and Uber have a strategic alliance that allows Uber customers to use Spotify to control the music during their ride. However each company still operates independently.\\nStrategic alliance allows companies to penetrate new markets and reach a new set of customers in a unique way. This would be of great benefit to a company such as ML Backpacks that is entering a foreign market.\\nIt also allows collaborating companies to share research and development costs, lowering the respective cost for each company \\nThat being said, when collaborating with an international alliance, cultural and language barriers may exist that make efficient communication difficult.\\nAnother downside with strategic alliance is that one company may lack the commitment needed to successfully employ the strategy, which is often the case when there in an unequal balance of benefits received from the alliance. \\n\\n(1 min)\\nAnastasiia:\\nPartnering with other firms is great, and joint venture allows for closer relationships between the 2 firms. Joint venture is when a firm entering a new market joins resources with a local firm to form a new company, sharing ownership, control, and profits. \\nThere are 2 types of Joint venture - First one is Contract Manufacturing: when foreign firm contracts a local firm for manufacturing. - 2nd one is Management Contracting: when domestic firm provides management expertise to a foreign firm.\\nSome of the advantages are that the local partner provides a greater understanding of the market and local resources such as vendors and real estate are more accessible. Also the Financial Burden reduces the financial risk for the entering firm.\\nSome of the disadvantages include Political and Economic Changes, differences in culture, management styles, and objectives, restrictions on moving profits back to the home country and imbalanced benefits which can lead to conflicts.\\n(1 min)\\n\\n\\nAnthony: \\n[Script about Direct Investment]\\n(1 min)\\nNext:\\nKristofer: Excellent! Seems like I’m paying you for a reason. Turning our attention back to the lowly consultants… Now, our team of internal analysts have shown that the US, China, and South Africa are the most attractive targets for expansion. In addition, we’ve narrowed down the two most promising expansion strategies for each country. However, this is where you come in. We’ll need everyone’s help to decide which strategy fits which country the best. I am, after all, a democratic man, so we will then have a vote to decide which country we should go for. I also strongly believe in incentives… So winning country, just know there’s something in it for you. \\n\\nPlease find your name on the board to find which country you’ll be discussing. USA is over there, China is over there, and South Africa is over there. \\n(30 Seconds) 43 seconds\\n[run class activity for 2 minutes].\\n\\nKristofer: Now what strategy did you choose for old Uncle Sam?\\n\\nKristofer: To China now. What did you guys come up with?\\n\\nKristofer: Last but certainly not least, South Africa. Lay it on me. \\n\\nKristofer: I see, well let's look a little into the pros and cons of each strategy.\\n\\nCynthuja: (1 min 2 secs)\\nLet’s take a look at the US. Exporting is an appealing strategy, and is relatively low risk, especially if we consider indirect exporting. We could expect to see faster sales growth and more immediate results with this strategy when compared to others. Direct exporting would require more risk and greater capital, but could provide us a more profitable alternative should indirect exporting prove viable. However, the financial upside of this strategy would be limited due to distributor partnerships and transportation costs across the US.\\n\\nLooking at a strategic alliance, the USA has a large economy and many small businesses that we could potentially create an alliance with. Infact, as of 2023, it is said that there are over 33 Million small businesses in the USA. Creating an alliance with one of these businesses would increase our brand awareness. Some disadvantages of creating an alliance in the US would be gaining unequal benefits and having conflicts within the alliance.\\n\\nHowever, overall we have decided that exporting would be the best strategy to consider when expanding into the USA, due to its low risk and no cultural barriers to expand.\\n\\n\\nAnthony:\\nTalk about pros and cons of china after transition\\n(1 min)\\n\\n\\nAnastasiia:\\nThe 2 strategies for South Africa are Exporting and Direct Investment.\\n\\nThe pros of Exporting include testing the market's response to the backpacks without a huge commitment. If the backpacks have high demand, the company can increase exports. It also helps avoid navigating local business regulations.\\n\\nThe Cons include a complicated import process with many tariff codes which may cause delays in the clearance of goods.

Reports show that over 55% of US households are actively gardening, and the industry size is at a record high. However the YOY growth of the industry is slowing, which experts attribute to post-pandemic lifestyle adjustments1. In Exhibit 1, this is represented by a pandemic spike in 2020, followed by years of steady decline. Globally, the Canadian gardening industry is smaller compared to other countries. As shown in Exhibit 2, the top 3 gardening industries are the US, China and Japan. The American gardening industry is particularly large, at over 20x the size of the Canadian gardening industry.\\nGardening app industry: The gardening app industry is an emerging industry, as most apps were released between 2017-2023. Despite its seasonality, revenue and downloads for gardening apps remain steady yearlong. In this month alone, gardening apps achieved over 1.3 million downloads and earned between <5K to over 4M USD (Exhibit 3, 4). This spread suggests that while the industry is unsaturated, a large disparity exists between the top vs. bottom performing apps. The app market itself remains fragmented as apps continue to grow. The majority of apps fall under either “photo classification”, “plant care help”, or “social planting”, with the former 2 higher in popularity. Geographically, gardening apps are well received particularly in the Americas. The US ranks as the top country of downloads, and other countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Canada also showed interest. While deeper market research on the gardening app industry is unavailable, comparisons can be drawn to the “smart indoor garden” industry. As a gardening tech industry that parallels the gardening industry, this industry is projected to increase significantly from 2018-2030. Its projected 9.3% growth rate is attributable to popularity growth in both gardening and smart technologies, which mirrors the gardening app industry. \\nEnvironmental Analysis (SWOT): \\nStrengths: Internally, GardenGram has sufficient resources to commence operations as it benefits from lower costs. App developers, product designers, and marketing managers are already acquired and form a strong team of human capital. Personal laptops and saved cash are sufficient as assets and capital to begin app development. Product-wise, GardenGram is positioned for success as few gardening apps are social and gamified. Consumers have yet to be satisfied with a definitive social gardening platform, which suggests less saturation and future possible partnerships with indirect competitors. Finally, GardenGram is competitively priced and placed effectively. More information on these strengths are available in the  marketing plan.\\nWeaknesses: As a social media-related startup, GardenGram suffers from low brand recognition and usage. Early adopters may struggle finding others to socialize with, and may lose interest. Without engaged, loyal customers, this free app should expect initial poor financial performance. In addition, GardenGram requires a high level of user commitment. Users must have a compatible device, internet connectivity, and an existing garden. User adoption is further hindered as GardenGram targets a unique segment of social gardeners. The novelty of the app concept means further market development will have to be done.\\nOpportunities: 53% of all US gardeners are 40+, and 68% of Canadians over 55 are gardening. A strong senior presence suggests that boomers and Gen X are good demographics to target with GardenGram. Culturally, Canadians are currently facing a “loneliness epidemic”. 1 in 10 people in Canada are always or often lonely, which rises to 1 in 5 for seniors. A social networking gardening app appeals to both these emotional and social needs. Furthermore, older generations have become more technologically literate. Consumers over the age of 55 are more online than before, and now seeking sources of leisure and entertainment. Their top-installed apps include reminder and puzzle/brain training apps, which GardenGram similarly addresses. Home ownership is also the highest among older demographics. Having more property and liquid capital makes seniors attractive users of GardenGram, as more possess sharable gardens and the ability to spend. \\nThreats: GardenGram suffers from a lack of proprietary material, and substitutes/copycats may adopt the app’s core design due to the low barriers to entry. In addition, seniors may have a level of distrust towards technology. With increasing concerns towards data privacy, this may result in future regulatory changes. These changes may impact GardenGram, as it will handle a large network of consumer location data, personal data, and images.\\n\\n\\nKey Learning / Conclusions:\\nGen X and Boomer gardeners have an unfulfilled need for socializing, gardening, and gaming. GardenGram must address all 3 of these needs using the principles of marketing.\\nGardenGram must differentiate from competitors while defending from substitutes by designing an irreplaceable system. \\nGardenGram must develop the gamified gardening segment and grow an existing, engaged customer base through careful understanding of its consumers. \\n\\n\\nKey Conclusions (executive summary):\\nTo ensure success, GardenGram must:\\nSatisfy the unfulfilled need for socializing, gardening, and gaming by senior citizens.\\nDifferentiate its product from competitors while defending from substitutes\\nDevelop the gamified gardening segment and grow an existing engaged customer base\\n\\nAppendices:\\n\\n\\nExhibit 3: Monthly downloads per common industry apps\\n\\nExhibit 4: Table of downloads and revenues by app'),\n",

That is, its external environment is directly connected to the gardening industry, and can be closely compared with other gardening industries. \\nGardening industry: \\nThe Canadian gardening industry is worth over 5.5 billion USD, and is expected to grow annually by 3.41% (statista). Additionally, gardening remains one of the top hobbies for consumers in North America. Reports show 55% of American households are actively gardening, and that the gardening industry size is at a record high. These are all positive trends for [App name] as it shows an increase in interest and willingness to spend within the garden industry\\n\\nHowever, experts believe that the slower industry growth compared to recent years is the result of post pandemic adjustment. As pandemic restrictions were once the main cause for many DIY gardening projects, the large number of new gardeners drove the growth of the industry in prior years. This is shown in the spike in growth in 2020 in Figure. However, the absence of these restrictions now results in fewer new gardeners. As a result, the industry is still expected to grow, albeit slower, in upcoming years. In Figure, this is represented by the steady decline that follows the initial spike in popularity. \\n\\n\\nWithin Canada, the gardening industry is smaller compared to other countries. As shown in Figure 2, the top 3 gardening industries are the US, China and Japan. The American gardening industry is particularly large, at over 20x the size of the Canadian gardening industry. As [App name] is based in Canada, this is a benefit as Canada is close in both proximity and culture to the United States. \\n\\n\\n\\nGardening App Industry\\nA survey on 10 prominent players within the gardening app industry was conducted using data collected from SensorTower and 42matters. \\n\\nAs examination of the release dates of the most prolific apps being show apps released as early as 2017 and as soon as 2022. This suggests that the gardening app industry is still emerging and unsaturated. This is beneficial for [App name], who is a new entrant to the industry. \\n\\n\\nAs shown above, downloads for gardening apps remain steady, even during the down seasons of gardening. As such, the launch of [App name] should expect a baseline level of users throughout the year. In addition, the market remains rather fragmented as users are open to experimenting with many different apps. Of these apps, most tend to fall into one of three distinct categories: “photo classification”, “plant care help”, or “social planting”. On average, these apps can earn monthly revenue ranging from less than 5000 dollars to over 4 million dollars. \\n\\n\\nThe spread in downloads and revenue suggest that while the industry is not saturated, a larger disparity exists between the top performing vs. the bottom performing apps. Thus, it is important for [App name] to be strongly positioned and differentiated from competitors. \\n\\nThese gardening apps are downloaded worldwide, but the largest share of app users also come from the Americas. The United States ranks as the top country of downloads for most of the selected apps, and other countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Canada also showed interest in these 3 segments of gardening apps. Again, this is favourable for [App name] as it is a North American-based app. \\n\\nAs the gardening app industry is still relatively new, deeper market research for gardening apps is scarcely available. However, comparisons for growth can be drawn to the similar “smart indoor garden” industry. This market parallels the gardening app industry in that both are early adopters of incorporating technology into gardening, and that both experienced surges in popularity during the pandemic. According to Emergen Research, the smart indoor garden segment is projected to increase significantly from 2018-2030. Its projected 9.3% growth rate is attributable to popularity growth in both gardening and smart technologies. Like the gardening industry, the US market also accounts for the largest revenue share, at 9% of global consumption. We can expect a similar trend in gardening apps. \\n\\n2. Environmental Analysis (SWOT)\\nStrengths:\\nInternally, [App name] has sufficient resources to commence operations. While initial costs can  be high for other startups, [App name] can benefit from lower operating costs in the opening months. We will not have to hire app developers, product designers, and marketing managers as these talents are already internally sourced and able to work. Furthermore, no additional capital is required as only a few laptops are currently required. With this, development on [App name] may even start immediately. \\n\\nAdditionally, our product is uniquely positioned. Few gardening apps focus on both the social and the gamified component of gardening. While clear market leaders have been established for plant identification and caretaking, consumers have yet to be satisfied with a definitive social gardening platform. This gap in demand suggests fewer strong competition, and leads to possible future partnerships with gardening apps who are not our direct competitors. The unique positioning for [App name] will be explored in more detail in [Section name]. \\n\\nFinally, [App name] is competitively priced and placed effectively. More information on these strengths are available in [Section names]. \\n\\nWeaknesses:\\nAs a social media-related startup, [App name] suffers from low brand recognition and low product usage. Without an existing base of engaged customers, there is no audience for newcomers to socialize with, which opposes the core concept of our app. This further implies that [App name] will have little/no consistent revenue streams in the first few months of operations, as it is planned to be priced as free (see [pricing section] for more information). \\n\\nIn addition, [App name] requires a high level of user commitment. To engage with our application, not only should users have access to a compatible device, but they also need internet connectivity and an existing garden. On top of this overhead cost, [App name] itself is a niche platform that targets the social gardener rather than a general gardener. Introducing a social gamified system to gardening is a novel concept among gardening apps, so market development will have to be done. More on target market segmentation can be found in [Section name]. \\nOpportunities: \\nA study conducted in 2021 by Research Co. and Glacier Media showed that 68% of Canadians aged 55+ and 57% of Canadians aged between 35-54 are currently gardening. Additionally, 53% of American gardeners are above the age of 40. A strong aging population suggests that by demographics alone, aging millennials and boomers may be a strong age group to target. \\n\\nAs for Canadian culture, most notably among Canadians is the coined “loneliness epidemic”. This cultural phenomenon is characterized by increased reports of loneliness throughout Canada, and occurs particularly among seniors. A study conducted by the government of Canada in 2021 showed that more than 1 in 10 people in Canada are always or often lonely, which rises to 1 in 4 for seniors. It is strongly believed that the trend of loneliness originates from the pandemic. A social networking app based on a popular activity among older Canadians may help address this need for community connection. \\n\\nAnother consequence of the pandemic is that older generations have become more technologically literate. Reports show that consumers over the age of 55 have been more online than before, and now looking for sources of leisure and entertainment. This is shown by the top installed apps by seniors/older millennials, which include reminder and puzzle/brain training apps. A gamified social media app could address this desire for leisure and entertainment. \\n\\nFurthermore, home ownership is the highest among seniors and older millennials. Reports show that compared to other age groups, seniors and older millennials are more likely to own property, have liquid capital, and less likely to save inheritance for younger generations. This makes this age group the most likely user of [App name], as they are most likely to have a garden they want to share. Additionally, their higher levels of wealth and willingness to spend will encourage in-app purchases offered by [App name].\\n\\nThreats\\n[App name] suffers from a lack of proprietary material. It is susceptible to substitutes that may copy the app’s core design. This is because of the low barriers to entry among gardening apps. \\n\\nIn addition, there may remain a certain level of distrust from certain seniors towards technology. This is coupled by increasing concerns towards data privacy, which may result in future regulatory changes. These changes may impact [App name], as it will need to handle a large network of consumer location data, personal data, and images.'),\n",

It was only a suspicion at the time, so I didn’t entirely believe it. But after yesterday night’s call and conversation, I’m not so sure anymore.\\n\\nMaybe I’m the problem. We’re just friends now, but I still feel jealous when she’s talking about her friends who make so much more than I do, and seem so much further ahead in life. It’s my problem that I feel the urge to compare myself to them and feel inferior afterwards. It’s my problem that I can’t overcome my want to monopolize her even when we’re only friends. \\n\\nI don’t know anymore. I think I’m just tired of this all. We call and we somehow talk about her friends who are better, and how nicely they treat her. This sounds like regular behaviour that friends do, but in my case I just can’t tolerate it. People are allowed to have friends and if I’m a genuine friend then I shouldn’t be stopping my friend from getting more friends. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, I think I feel a bit defeated. During my calls with her, I no longer want to see her face because I worry that I’ll fall head over heels again. Rather, I look at my own face. I see myself smiling away the pain whenever she mentions her friend makes $8k and takes her out to dinner. In the minutes that I stared at my own pained smile, I knew that something was wrong. \\n\\nI think chasing after Ashley is like chasing after a fleeting moment. These are moments that aren’t meant to last, that you’re only supposed to enjoy in the moment. I think that the consequence that results from chasing after what’s already lost are feelings of inadequacy and self-resentment. I hate how I wasn’t such a bitter person just a few days ago, when these situations were out of sight, out of mind. \\n\\nMaybe I’m more suited to live a blissful and unaware life. I don’t think I’m awakening to the “harsh reality” of life or anything. The self-made achievements that her friends have made are the results of their hard work, so it’s only fair that they should reap the benefits of it. Despite that, I think I deserve to be happy with my position as well. Though I’m inferior career-wise on a face value comparison, overall we are all doing fine. We are all headed towards stable employment, and it’s highly likely that even I will find my place in society. \\n\\nTalking with Ashley… maybe we are both at fault. It feels like I’m betraying her when I’m assigning this blame to her, as I know I’m really a snowflake. Even still, I think it’s a bit cruel for her to talk about these things to me. If she was a bit more considerate, she’d understand that her words kill me. I don’t want to drag myself into her race when I have my own to run. So much of me can only be dedicated to someone who can’t reciprocate much back. (it hurt to type that).\\n\\nThis document is not meant to insult Ashley’s character, even if I have my own internal thoughts about it. Some things are just not meant to even be materialized into words, as they bring me no contribution. I think it’s what made this document so hard to articulate.\\n\\nShe will find her happiness. I will find my happiness. We may not find it in each other, and the way we find our happiness will not be in the ways we both expect. But at the minimum, I can firmly say that it’s time to put things to a rest, and accept the distant friendship we were meant to have. \\n\\n================\\n\\nI… still like you. Even if I mean nothing to you. In my dreams where we’re still close are where I find myself the happiest. \\n\\nMy everyday has become so lonely and bleak. School is no challenge, but everything else is. I’ve tried to preoccupy myself so much that you wouldn’t stay in my mind, and yet you’re still there in my dreams. You linger in the back of my mind with every calculated move I do.\\n\\nDo you know how strange it was seeing the sunset last night? I couldn’t help but think about your profile picture and the Spotify album we shared. The sunset was rosy pink with confident streaks of orange racing across. Though I would usually say to myself: “What a beautiful day”, yesterday I could only stare at it lifelessly.\\n\\nAnd so I deleted our shared album from my liked playlists. I’ve already deleted you from my Discord, and in the future I’ll delete you from my Findmy.\\n\\nNone of this is your fault. I’ve fallen way too deeply in love with you, and only I am to blame. I hope you don’t forgive me. I hope we don’t talk again, I hope you do well.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nI wonder if you realize why I called for a meeting this weekend. Do you know that I actually don’t care for our project anymore? \\n\\nI had another dream about you again. Like most naps that I have, they end up being somewhat sporadic and especially vicarious. In my dream, I was actually preparing for this conversation. I can’t remember it too well now, but I’ll still try to recall it. \\n\\nWe were calling on the phone. You were talking about your life, while I was talking about mine. We were not clicking at all. It seemed we couldn’t hold a conversation, for what it was worth. We went through the motion of our unique conversation, with no heart embedded into our words. A talk about our monotonous lives here and there, followed by some shallow, polite laughter. If this is what my call with you will be like, then I don’t think I’ll call again. \\n\\nThe call then suddenly disconnected. I tried to call you back but woke up instead. The dream wasn’t too meaningful, but like myself in the dream, I woke up feeling anxious and disappointed. \\n\\nIt’s surprising what love can do to someone like me. I know I should hate you, and I’ve positioned my mentality to do so. I’ve developed such a blind hatred that I can’t even rationally explain why I dislike you. On the other hand, the days I’ve spent waiting for your replies are the traces of my love for you. \\n\\n=========\\n\\nI’m in so much pain right now. Did you really have to lie your way out of calling with me? What is our friendship even? Is it even real anymore?\\n\\nIt hurts so much. It hurts so much. I want to end things with you. I want a conclusion to things. I want to put you into the past so I don't need to remember you any more. \\n\\nHow could you do this to me? How? I thought we were going to be lasting friends. I really did. We were so close during the summer, and I thought I could even be a long term friend in your life. \\n\\nI see it isn’t the case. I feel betrayed. Did you talk with me because you were lonely? Is the reason why we don’t talk anymore because you found a new set of friends to share your life with? How can you be so cruel to me? I truly thought we had a genuine connection, a genuine friendship. I found someone I could relate with at last. But, it seems that was not the case. \\n\\nI’m just in so much pain. Maybe it would be better if we didn’t meet again. Maybe it would be. \\n\\nI don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried everything to alleviate this. I watched the Jays, I’ve prepped for interviews, I’ve dedicated more time to Huawei, I’ve joined dragon boat, I’ve joined volleyball, I’ve talked to new people, I’ve given myself a new routine. \\n\\nOne day, I think I’m going to write something here that I will regret. I thought my mentality was virtuous and strong, but it can’t stand the test of time and all the anxiety that surrounds me. \\n\\nAshley, despite everything that I’ve said, I know it’s not your fault. I’ve been unreasonable, I’ve been unresponsive, and I’ve been trying to cut you out of my own life. \\n\\nI lied. It is your fault. Not all, but at least some. Both you and I are responsible for the pain I am feeling right now. It hurts so much.\\n\\nI will kill off the remaining shred of expectation I have for you. You don’t have to do anything anymore, just keep doing what you have been doing. My life will be painful for a bit, but it can only be more painful with you in it. \\n\\n============\\n\\n(copied from “text to Ashley”)\\nText to Ashley: \\n\\nBy reading this document, I hope we’re able to have a candid conversation about the status of our friendship. I hope you’re able to see what’s happening from my perspective, and share about what’s happening on your side. \\n\\n======================\\n\\nYou know when something happens in life, and it suddenly reminds you of a certain friend? It could be a post, a song, or even something mundane such as a sunset. For me, in those moments, I get the urge to share the feeling. \\n\\nRecently it’s been getting harder and harder to talk to you. On my end, I’ve been talking less because I’ve been doubting if you care. I’ve been more demanding because I figured you would have to respond. And lastly, I’ve revealed less of my emotions because it makes it easier to internally accept if you don’t end up responding. The result is that I’ve been unsending messages more and more frequently. \\n\\nI’ve sometimes wondered if I’m having so many thoughts because I once liked you. I couldn’t figure out if I wanted to share certain moments because of my romantic interest, or because of our friendship. I want this text to be framed more on friendship, so I hope you respond in earnest.\\n\\nFor me, I’ve gotten very confused over the meaning of friendship. We spent so much time talking to each other over the summer months, only to abruptly stop once school started. I’ve accepted that I should leave my romantic feelings for you behind in that summer, but I wasn’t sure where to place my friendship with you. I knew we couldn’t continue as is, so I’d like to use your input to redefine it.\\n\\nSo here is my most important question: \\n\\nWhat sort of friendship do you envision this to be? \\n\\n\\nI don’t think I’ve been the greatest friend either. There are a couple of things that I’ve done that friends wouldn’t do to friends. \\n\\nDo you have any questions for me? I’m willing to explain anything.\\n\\n=========\\n\\nI think I’m getting closer to letting go of you, thanks to you. Maybe you’re being intentional with the way you’re treating me. If so, then I guess you’re a saint. \\n\\nOn Friday, I received a text message from you, saying that your midterms were mostly over and that you’d have more time to talk now. The moment I received it, I felt a bit angry. But once I got over the initial shock, we had a nice conversation where we caught up with each other. I appreciated that this time, you reached out to me.\\n\\nDuring our conversation we agreed to play TFT during the weekend. I wasn’t available the same Friday, but I figured I’d be available Saturday night. So Saturday night, I messaged you about playing and hoped that we’d get 1 or 2 games in. \\n\\nIn the end, you didn’t reply. In fact, later the same night I saw you playing (again) with another person. \\n\\nWhile it’s ok to play with other friends, you should’ve at least told me. You should’ve told me that you wouldn’t be available so I wouldn’t be waiting all night. The following day, you shouldn’t have said that you forgot to check your messages when I knew you were using your phone to play the game. \\n\\nAt this point, I could reach out. I could do another intervention about communication, honesty, whatnot. But I’m honestly just done with this. You’re a wonderful person for sure, but I don’t want to be the person who corrects your bad habits. I don’t want to continuously complain to you about the state of our relationship. I don’t want to keep hoping that you’d suddenly change, and for real this time. Like I mentioned in previous journals, that is your decision, and this is mine.\\n\\nTo tell the truth, (and because I’ll never share you this document, for your sake), I’m pretty wary of your personality now. You’re driven to achieve your goals, but you kinda discard everyone else that is not relevant. And most importantly, you don’t respect me. If this was a game show and I needed a friend to immediately respond, I wouldn’t rely on you. \\n\\nIn the end, I think this sucks. But I guess it’s also a part of life. I hope I’ll be able to learn from this experience.\"),\n",

It may also be an indicator of having good communication skills. In this sense, the quality of a cover letter/resume may be useful towards screening for marketing managers, as it is a position that requires proficiency in communication. \\nHowever, as evaluating resumes is a subjective process, screening for a marketing manager can be done using computing software. This would evaluate applicants in a more consistent manner. \\n\\nInternet Checks and Phone Screening:\\nInternet checks involve using a google search to determine the fit of an applicant. For a marketing manager, this could be a particularly effective way of screening, as the duties of a marketing manager are strongly relevant to their ability to interact with others.\\nPhone screening allows hiring managers to screen applicants using a quick phone or video call. This may be useful for assessing the social abilities of applicants, as conversations are harder to prepare for. In terms of screening potential marketing managers, this may provide a useful preview of an applicant’s social interaction skills. \\n\\nApplication form:\\nThe length and questions on an application form vary depending on the type of organization. This being said, they are generally a form applicants fill out to provide written answers on the broad topics of relevant job experience, education and references.\\n\\nFor managers and higher level roles, such as the Marketing Manager role we have selected, application forms are typically more detailed and extensive. Questions about relevant experience, references, etc may overlap with information given on the resume, but may provide a more personal and in-depth view of the candidate. Statistics have also shown applicants to be more honest on application forms due to a common practice of having them sign to verify the authenticity of their answers. One thing to note is that questions about criminal history, disabilities and citizenship should be avoided in this case. \\n\\n\\nInterview Types\\nNondirective interviews: unstructured in nature, as opposed to structured interviews. The interviewer refrains from influencing the applicant’s answers and asks broad, open ended questions. \\n\\nStructured interviews: further classified into situational and behavioural description interviews.\\n-Situational: The applicant is given a hypothetical situation and asked how they might respond to it. The response is then measured against pre-set standards\\n-Behavioural Description: Focuses on actual work situations in the applicant’s past, drawing upon the applicant’s past experiences (i.e. when was the last time you disciplined an employee)\\n\\nIt is worth noting that these different types of interviews can be given either sequentially or in panel format. Sequential format involves the applicant being individually interviewed by multiple people in sequence, while panel format involves a group of people interviewing a single candidate simultaneously. There are also options relating to the setting of the interview, as it could be held online or in-person.\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nAccording to an article by Career Group Company about the important qualities of a marketing hire, marketing managers are typically evaluated on their knowledge of current tools and platforms as well as their relationship building skills. The best option to efficiently screen applicants for these qualities is the internet check and phone screening. By looking at the candidate’s online presence, one can evaluate their ability to present themselves and build relationships online, as well as potentially their skills and involvement in past projects. The phone screening is much quicker than a full interview, but is unique amongst the initial screening options because it allows Maple Leaf to talk to the applicant and gain an idea of their soft skills and relationship building abilities. \\n\\nThis answer is based on the assumption that we could only choose one screening method: in a real hiring scenario, a mix would likely produce the best results, for example with the resume providing the most detailed account of technical skills and past experience, and the phone screening evaluating soft skills. \\n\\nDifferent types of pre-employment tests:\\nJob knowledge test\\nTest a person’s level of understanding about a job.\\nWork Sample test\\nRequires applicants to perform tasks that are a part of the work\\nAssessment center test\\nEvaluate one/groups of candidates in a series of simulations that resemble typical job duties\\nCognitive ability test\\nMeasure mental abilities such as intelligence, verbal fluency.\\n\\nRecommendation (Employment Tests):\\nWhen hiring a marketing manager, it's important to strike a balance between assessing their technical knowledge and their ability to build and maintain relationships. One method to gauge a candidate’s technical capabilities would be the Work Sample Tests. Work sample tests are extremely valuable when assessing a marketing manager’s practical skills. You are able to observe candidates completing tasks related to the job in real time, such as creating a sample digital marketing plan, examining a marketing case, or demonstrating knowledge and efficiency with spreadsheet and data analysis software. \\n\\nThe Cognitive Ability Tests are less apt for hiring a marketing manager specifically, but can still be utilized for determining a candidates critical-thinking, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, which are quite important to the role. “As a marketer, you need to be able to think critically about your work. As I have said above, there never seems to be enough time in the day to complete everything that needs to be done. We’re always trying new things and implementing changes to different areas of our business. However, when dealing with current clients, critical thinking on an ad hoc basis is critical for long-term success. If a candidate has not thought critically about an assessment task that may have been biased or not as equal, things will fall apart for them in the future if they cannot do so” (Debi, 2022).\\n\\n“Whereas cognitive ability tests measure a person’s intellectual capability, personality tests measure disposition and temperament,” (Belcourt, pg. 238). In the marketing industry, a great personality alone can take you very far. Personality and Interest Inventories are a very suitable method to gauge a potential marketing manager’s personality, interpersonal and relationship-building skills, as well as their ability to converse and operate in group settings. Marketing managers often need to work with cross-functional teams, interact with clients, and build partnerships, all of which require a high level of competence in the aforementioned social skills. Additionally, “personality tests can be better predictors of employee motivation, such as their leadership efforts and propensity to adhere to rules. Five dimensions have been shown to reliably summarize personality traits. The “Big Five” factors are the following:\\n\\nExtraversion—the degree to which someone is talkative, sociable, active, and excitable\\nAgreeableness—the degree to which someone is trusting, friendly, generous, tolerant, cooperative, and flexible\\nConscientiousness—the degree to which someone is dependable and organized and perseveres in tasks\\nEmotional stability—the degree to which someone is secure, calm, independent, and autonomous\\nOpenness to experience—the degree to which someone is intellectual, philosophical, insightful, creative, artistic, and curious” (Belcourt, pg. 238).\\n\\nNot only will personality tests illustrate if a candidate possesses the necessary marketing soft skills and abilities, it will also give an indication of employee motivation. Out of the three pre-employment tests, personality tests are the most valuable and applicable to the marketing manager position.\\n\\nReferences \\nBelcourt, M. (1996). Chapter 6: Employee Selection.

That is, a feeling of longing for you, and a glimmer of hope that maybe one day I’ll defy all odds and be with you. Of course it won’t last forever, but it will be here for a while. \\n\\nI’ve come to realize the reality of the situation. We may never talk again. We may never meet again. If we are to meet in Daegu this coming winter, then we may never meet after that. \\n\\nI don’t think you’ve upheld your end of our promises. I don’t think you regret much, either. To be honest, I was upset with you for a while but now I’m ok too. \\n\\nI’m not okay in the sense that my emotions have settled, but I’m ok in the sense that I’ve accepted that this is your choice. \\n\\nOn my walk back to campus today, I was thinking about how I should approach our future. My friend proposed that I never reach out to you again. I thought about her suggestion for a while. I didn’t want to leave you completely, in case we are to someday meet again. But as my friend pointed out, I believed this was only the case as I held residual feelings for you. \\n\\nSo I thought of it some more. Part of me was unsure if burning bridges was the correct option. Even now, I’m not so certain if I should give up on this hope. I thought about whether I should leave some consideration for you, in case you ever reach out to me again. \\n\\nMy answer is: no. I shouldn’t give anyone consideration if they won’t give any to me. I’ve tried everything to uphold my side of our relationship, yet you haven’t done anything on yours. I’ve clearly communicated my problems with you, which you’ve only bandaged, but not fixed. I’ve played this game with you 3 times already, and 3 times I’ve been eventually ignored and left alone. I don’t think you deserve my consideration anymore. Rather, I should be thinking for myself.\\n\\nMy friend tells me I shouldn’t meet you in Daegu, for my sake. I think I should follow their advice, but only for the right reason. I shouldn’t decline meeting you in Daegu out of spite because I’ve felt wronged. Instead, I should decline for my own sake. I should decline for the sake of my overly attached self, and for the sake of moving past you in life. \\n\\nThis might not be my last journal entry to you, but I can sense things are coming to a close.

The elevator can be doing one of four things: it can be moving up, it can be moving down, it can be stopped with the door closed, or it can be stopped with the door open. These four things correspond to the states of your controller. \\nThere are three inputs to your controller: Up (U), Down (D), and Open Door (OD), and there are three outputs: Go Up (GU), Go Down (GD), and Door Open (DO). You do not have to worry about selecting the floor, or deciding if you have reached the desired floor, or handling multiple floors being selected. Instead, if a floor above the current floor has been selected, then U will be high; if a floor below the current floor has been selected, then D will be high. When a desired floor has been reached, both the U and D inputs will go low for 1 clock cycle, and then go high again if a floor above (or below) the current floor has been selected. \\nWhen in the stopped-with-door-closed state, then the following should happen, de pending on which inputs are high: \\n• If all of the inputs are low, we should remain in the stopped-with-door-closed state. \\n• If the OD signal is high, the elevator door should be opened for one clock cycle (i.e., the DO output should be high for one clock cycle), after which the elevator should return to the stopped-with-door-closed state. \\n• If the OD signal is low and the D signal is high, the elevator should start moving in the downward direction, and it should continue moving in the downward direction until the D signal goes low, at which point the elevator should stop with the door closed. \\n• If both the OD and D signals are low and the U signal is high, then the elevator should move in the upward direction and continue moving in the upward direction until the U signal goes low, at which point the elevator should stop with the door closed. \\nGive a finite state diagram for this elevator controller; you do not need to give state tables or output tables. We have drawn the states on the next page; make the center state in the diagram the “Stop with door closed” state; you can choose which of the other three bubbles correspond to the other three states. \\nBe sure to give your states state numbers, noting in your solution which state cor responds to which number.

Assume that zero (0) is a positive number for this question. \\n(c) (3 pts) Mult-4 (M4): If the input M4=1 then the Result should be a multiple of 4; if the Result coming out of the 1-bit ALU’s is not a multiple of 4, then Result0 and Result1 should be set to 0 and the other Result bits should remain unchanged. If M4=0 or Result coming out of the 1-bit ALUs is already a multiple of 4, then the Result should be unchanged from what’s in the current diagram.

An aspect of job design that would make this position more motivating is the potential of making impactful change. As someone who is expected to “develop and commercialise product innovation [...] within sustainable meats”, this is something that is certainly impactful and possible with the team that they will be managing. \\n\\nIndustrial engineering concerns:\\nTechnologies such as ChatGPT can greatly improve the workflow, and subsequently the motivation, of a marketing manager. Given their strong emphasis on text communication, with 100% of workers using communication via email “every day”, ChatGPT can ensure quality emails are quickly composed and sent. For the Sustainable Foods Marketing Manager, ChatGPT may help them “collaborate with Brand Marketing to develop and implement [a] robust consumer communication plan for Canada and the US”.\\n\\nBehavioural concerns:\\nWork efficiency and job satisfaction can both be derived from intrinsic motivation. A successful Sustainable Foods Marketing Manager should believe in their cause by caring for sustainability and valuing stakeholder communication. A skill that is listed is the ability to be a “strong team player [...] with a well-developed people interaction skill set”.\\n\\nErgonomic considerations:\\nFor organisational efficiency, MLF has adopted a hybrid work model. This may be more accommodating for certain employees. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences \\nMORRIS, B.S. S. (2022).

I hope you’re able to see what’s happening from my perspective, and share about what’s happening on your side. \\n\\n======================\\n\\nYou know when something happens in life, and it suddenly reminds you of a certain friend? It could be a post, a song, or even something mundane such as a sunset. For me, in those moments, I get the urge to share the feeling. \\n\\nRecently it’s been getting harder and harder to talk to you. On my end, I’ve been talking less because I’ve been doubting if you care. I’ve been more demanding because I figured you would have to respond. And lastly, I’ve revealed less of my emotions because it makes it easier to internally accept if you don’t end up responding. The result is that I’ve been unsending messages more and more frequently. \\n\\nI’ve sometimes wondered if I’m having so many thoughts because I once liked you. I couldn’t figure out if I wanted to share certain moments because of my romantic interest, or because of our friendship. I want this text to be framed more on friendship, so I hope you respond in earnest.\\n\\nFor me, I’ve gotten very confused over the meaning of friendship. We spent so much time talking to each other over the summer months, only to abruptly stop once school started. I’ve accepted that I should leave my romantic feelings for you behind in that summer, but I wasn’t sure where to place my friendship with you. I knew we couldn’t continue as is, so I’d like to use your input to redefine it.\\n\\nSo here is my most important question: \\n\\nWhat sort of friendship do you envision this to be? \\n\\n\\nI don’t think I’ve been the greatest friend either. There are a couple of things that I’ve done that friends wouldn’t do to friends. \\n\\nDo you have any questions for me? I’m willing to explain anything.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'Social media kind of person', 'date': '2023-09-19T20:08:37.158Z'}, page_content='I woke up this morning with a strong sense of frustration. I still can’t figure out why that was, but maybe I’ll figure out something about myself as I write this document. \\n\\nA bit about this one - it’s actually a document I had in planning for a while now. I had given it a title over a week ago, but never got into the mood or had the presence of mind to write it. \\n\\nIn my bout of morning frustration, I started by watching IG reels. I saw an interesting movie called “The Equalizer”. Seeing the scenes of the main character intimidate and mutilate his opponents for his own version of justice was incredibly satisfying, so I proceeded to watch over 1hrs of movie clips of “The Equilizer 2” and “John Wick”.\\n\\nI think this is why people enjoy watching movies. It was such a thrilling form of escapism. My usual life is so tiring, and these days I’ve only been building up dissatisfaction and frustration. I was able to vicariously live through these main characters, and have them take on my frustrations and relieve them in my place. \\n\\nLately I’ve been unhappy with myself. Yes, I’ve gotten 7 interviews. Yes, most of them went well. Yes, the ones that didn’t go well will be fantastic learning experiences. Yes, my current position is better than most. \\n\\nI just feel as if there’s something I’m missing. The most instinctual answer is “Ashley”, but I think the root cause is much deeper than that. Maybe it’s the idea of Ashley that I’m still attached to, but not actually the person themselves. \\n\\nDavid told me something late last night that made me realize something. He told me that my friendship with Ashley is only bringing me pain and worry, and that friendships shouldn’t do this. \\n\\nThis entire time, I’ve been defending Ashley. I’ve been saying things like “friends wouldn’t do such and such to their friends”, and so I believed my worries were unjustified and only I’m being a bad friend. If I follow David’s words, that might not be the case. If Ashley had us as equals, then she’d initiate conversations, she’d reply sooner, and she’d keep part of me in the back of her mind. From the interactions I’ve had with her, I’ve realized very little of that is the case. I never hear from her anymore, and I’ve become an outsider in her life. It’s her choice, so I’ll choose to dislike her accordingly. \\n\\nSo thank you, David. Thanks to you I think I’m one step closer to moving on. \\n\\nThis document mentioned very little of social media, so I should now honour it. \\n\\nPart of my dreariness is from a sense of loneliness. Sometimes I look at my phone and am met by 0 notifications. When the time is right, this makes me feel like a social failure and a person who is unwelcomed by everyone. \\n\\nSubconsciously, I think I’ve diverted my attention to social media. Who can say that my friends don’t care for me, if I have content creators sharing their lives with me? Who can say that I have no one to talk with if I’m looking down at my phone being “busy”? I’ve spent so much time doom scrolling IG and Reddit that it has made me realize how pathetic I think I am. I think this has taught me a lesson about society, as I’ve noticed others who parallel my behaviour. For better or for worse, I can sympathize with them now. \\n\\nWould you just look at where I am now. The moment I lose my job I will have nothing left (barring family). I feel like a lame failure whose character is maintained by the belief that I am employable. I’m not even sad, I think I’m way past that. I’m just broken. \\n\\nSorry for being such a downer. Future Anthony, if you read this, you have to remember the importance of these documents. Don’t look back on them, and only remember how it has helped the previous you struggle through life. Have some respect for all the versions of you, in both the past and the future. \\n\\nYou can bury the present in your own words right here.'),\n",

Also check out our Splunk company overview! \\n\\nWe’ve put together this guide to answer any burning questions that you may have about our interview process. \\n\\n\\nWhat is the interview process like?\\nPLEASE NOTE: All interviews will be conducted virtually via Zoom. \\nThe format will be a 1hr 50 min time block where you will have 2 – 45 minute virtual interviews back-to-back with Splunk engineers, with a 5 minute break in-between interviews to accommodate for the change in interviewers. At the end of the interview you will have an extra 10 minutes. This is due to how the schedules are set-up in the WaterlooWorks scheduling tool.\\nYour interviews will cover both technical and behavioral capabilities. The platforms you will be using for your interviews are Zoom and Codility. Codility has live coding features. You will be asked to whiteboard during your interviews so please be prepared. If the interviewer asks you to code in a language that you aren’t familiar with, just let them know this isn’t something you’ve covered yet, and offer an alternative coding language. They are mostly assessing how well you solve, so the language you code in is not as important as the way in which you approach the problem. \\n\\nBack-end and front-end engineer candidates, during your interviews you will have the opportunity to meet with engineers from different teams. It’s not until after you’ve accepted an offer that we match you to a team. You will be provided a list of available teams and asked to rank your preferences during the matching process so I encourage you to prepare questions for your interviewers to learn more about their team and day in the life. \\nHow should I prepare for the interview?\\n\\nTechnical Interview Prep:\\nDo your research!

Practice coding live and explaining your problem solving techniques out loud. The platform we use for technical interviews is Codility, which has live coding features. A few things to remember:\\nIf the interviewer asks you to code in a language that you aren’t familiar with, just let them know this isn’t something you’ve covered yet, and offer an alternative coding language. They are mostly assessing how well you problem-solve, so the language you code in is not as important as the way in which you approach the problem. \\nThink out loud. It is important that the interviewer understands your thought process, so be communicative about how you are thinking about the problem.\\nAsk clarifying questions. Be sure you understand exactly what you are trying to solve before you jump in.\\nAsk for help. If you get stuck on the problem, ask your interviewer for help. We highly value your ability to learn quickly, and if you get a hint from your interviewer that helps you the problem, that tells us you can learn.\\nDownload Splunk.

I’d like to see how HR impacts the products that consumers like me can enjoy. \\nOwen - Maple Leaf Foods is a company that, at least on the surface, seems to be purpose driven and endeavoring to benefit all stakeholders. I would like to study this organization to see if it is really purpose driven when put under scrutiny and analyzed, or if it is just a front for PR purposes. \\nSpencer - While many food production companies rely on cutting corners to stay relevant, Maple Leaf Foods has put a great deal of effort and focus into sustainability while still producing high quality food. I am curious to look further into how they pull this off and how various HR strategies affect their success.\\nEric - Maple Leaf Foods has a lasting commitment to sustainable products for the community, with real ingredients and being carbon neutral, potential employees are drawn to the organization. I also have found myself eating their products on numerous occasions when shopping at shoppers and walmart.\\nEmma - It will be interesting to look into such a big and recognizable Canadian organization. This brand is the first one that comes to mind whenever I think about meat products and it will be cool to take a look behind the scenes in this course. \\nStrategic Vision:\\nOur vision is to be the most sustainable protein company on earth.

Maybe I’m writing this for you, Ashley, so that one day I could share this with you and everything will seem clear. Maybe I’m writing this for myself, so I can justify to myself why I decided to stop chasing after someone I like so much. Maybe I’m writing this for no one, because maybe no one will read this document after its initial creation.\\n\\nI don’t even think I need to cope right now. I think this is something I could’ve internalized on my own, and yet I’m turning to this document again. I think I’m turning to this document to preserve the feelings of my first love that I’ve had in 5 years. Maybe I am a bit of a romanticist, at the end of the day. \\n\\nIn writing this document I will go through the steps that I found in an online article yesterday. It’s called “10 steps to moving on”, and of all places it’s from a tutorialspoint article. Though, it’s very misleading that I’m using a breakup article to guide my feelings, even though we had never dated. I think part of myself just wanted us to date a little too badly, for a little too long. \\n\\nAcknowledge the pain\\nAfter I confessed to you, my feelings didn’t feel correct at certain times. Maybe it isn’t a stretch to say they weren’t right at all anymore. Rather than respecting your decisions and thinking in your best interests, I could only think of what was best for me. I could only think of the best way I could reconvince you to focus your attention on me, and to like me instead. I was delusioned in thinking there was a realistic chance that you liked me back, and so held onto those feelings a little too closely. \\n\\nI think that’s the reason why when you shared that you were hanging out with a friend that asked you out, I was struck with a strong cognitive dissonance. Would it make sense for someone who I believed to like me, to be going places with someone who’s attracted to them? More ironically so, they’re doing this despite me encouraging them to do so? (yes, you read that right) Facing my delusions directly made me realize how lost I was, and how in need I was of a mental reset. \\n\\nYou might think that I was fine on the surface, but you’d be wrong. The fact that your friend was feeding you so well today, and will continue to do so tomorrow is getting on my nerves. The fact that you agreed to drink alcohol with him is also irritating me. The fact that I have to tolerate this while liking you is truly killing me from the inside. \\n\\nIn whichever way that this applied to my “possessive, obsessive, and anxious” personality traits, I only know that I felt bitter at the end, and knew I had to bring it to a stop before things got worse. \\n\\nIf I am to date someone in the future, I don’t want to tolerate this level of vagueness. I don’t want your attention to be shared with anyone except for mine. This sort of situation is simply something I can’t tolerate while I’m a self-respecting person, and so I should become normal friends with you before anything else happens. \\n\\nTake the time to heal\\nToday I told you I didn’t know how long I needed to heal, which was the truth. In fact, I didn’t even know how “healed” I wanted to be by the time I next talked to you. Can one really judge their level of healing on their own? How would I know I’m not texting you again because I’m unhealthily obsessed with you? \\n\\nThe healing duration is a bit of a problem, as well. If I heal too quickly, does it mean I didn’t like you too much, after all? If I heal too slowly, would’ve we forgotten each other by then? \\n\\nIt’s important that goals are clear and defined if we truly want to achieve them. My criteria for not liking you will either be that I fall for someone else, or that I’m able to spend a day without you showing up in my mind. Whichever comes first, maybe then I’ll be able to face you again. As well, if things drag out for too long, I’ll be sure to send you updates as I rehab. \\n\\nReflect on the relationship\\nThere is nothing I regret. I don’t even regret acting jealous or acting possessive. I think during our interactions, thanks to both of us, I was able to act true to myself even until the end. I’m still at a stage in my life where I’m allowed to be selective with my partners, so surely I’ll be able to learn some lessons later. Maybe in the future, when I’m 50 and struggling to settle down, will I reconsider it all if I haven’t yet. \\n\\nCreate a new routine. \\nIt will be difficult while I’m in Korea, but once school starts I will intentionally work harder than I have ever before. Let’s brainstorm some things I will do to distract my mind:\\nLeetcode\\nApply for jobs\\nRead the next day’s lecture notes\\nGo to gym\\nJog\\n\\nI plan on recovering all my grades this coming term. I don’t want evaluators to think I’m falling off. I know my classes next term are easy, so I will take this chance to capitalize and demonstrate. \\n\\nConnect with friends and family\\nNah I’m good. We connect regularly anyways. \\n\\nAllowing yourself to feel your emotions. \\nDo not drink alcohol. I repeat. Do not drink alcohol. \\n\\nFinding healthy ways to cope.\\nI think I thankfully stopped things before it could get out of hand, but at the same time I’ll be needing a lot of distractions to help move my mind elsewhere. I think I already mentioned some of my strategies above. \\n\\nSeek professional help\\n???\\n\\nFind a new hobby:\\nNo\\n\\nCreate new goals\\nNo'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': '5 pages and more', 'date': '2023-08-28T05:59:56.307Z'}, page_content=\"Ashley once told me that she wanted to see 5 pages of why someone liked her, if anyone was to confess to her. This task is a bit challenging, as even now I still have many doubts. Nonetheless,I think I’ll be able to produce a 5 page love letter with all the thoughts that’ve been running through my mind lately.\\n\\nI think this document will be a bit different from the ones I usually write. My usual google drive of “coping docs” are not meant for anyone else to see, but this doc is something I intend to eventually share with Ashley if the right time ever comes. I’ll still do some light proofreading, but as far as my coping docs go, this document will be my thoughts alone, and written with little revision. \\n\\nAs a final preface, I think my feelings are a bit more complicated than just pure “liking”. I think I will separate this document into 2 sections: a public and a private section. Similar to OOP, haha. There are some thoughts that just don’t belong in a love letter, while some others that do. Regardless, both documents will be my honest thoughts. \\n\\nThis will be the 5 page document that she’s been looking for, though it’s possible she’ll never see it. I’ll have some fun writing this.\\nIt really hasn’t been that long since I first met you in Daegu.Though it’s only been a little over a year, in my mind it feels like it’s been so much longer. \\n\\nI think I can explain this with something you always say: “Out of sight, out of mind”. We’ve spent so much time apart within this past year that everything I did last summer feels a bit like a distant dream. My mind would never expect that just one year ago, I’d be meeting someone who I currently believe to like so much. \\n\\nI think this letter will be a bit similar to the call when I first confessed. I’ll go over all the events that have occurred starting from that summer and up until now. And along the way, I hope you’ll be able to realize all the reasons for why I like you. But of course, I’ll also guide you along and state certain reasons explicitly. \\n\\n****************************\\n\\nLeading up to when I first met you, I can’t say that I had the purest of intentions. At a certain lunch meeting between our dads, your dad had brought up the idea that I should meet you. At that time, with my soaring confidence and a certain degree of cockiness, I thought your dad was trying to offer you to me. \\n\\nI think that was part of the reason why when I first met you, I said: “you’re shorter than I thought”. When I think back to that moment, I can’t help but be mad at myself. At that time, I thought that since height wasn’t important to me, it wouldn’t be important to others as well. If I could, then I would give my past self a firm slap for saying that, and for making those assumptions. \\n\\nWhile it’s romantic to say that I fell in love when you were taking me around Daegu, life is neither as perfect nor as simple as you might think. Rather, the reason I liked you came from whatever we could share within just two afternoons. In our brief time together, I liked that you were:\\nPretty \\nPretty introverted\\nSmart\\nFunny\\nHardworking\\nFinancially stable\\n\\nBefore reading into each bullet point, keep in mind that these were my thoughts only after meeting you once. Meaning, they are shallow in nature: \\nPretty:\\nYour IG pfp was pretty, and you looked even better when I met you in person. It felt like I was being reverse-catfished. \\nIntroverted:\\nI liked the cute, sheepish, but also prideful way you were showing me around Daegu.\\nI think I may have a thing for introverted girls.\\nSmart: \\nYou go to Berkeley.\\nFunny: \\nWhen you spoke of your beliefs, you spoke in a firm but blunt way. I think I’m into that. \\nHardworking:\\nI misunderstood that you did 2 extra years of highschool just to get into the university that you wanted to. While we later cleared that misunderstanding, this was the core reason I fell for you. I value effort above all else, so seeing such a dedicated display of effort was something that appealed the most to my values.\\nYou were driven to transfer into CS, which I thought was very admirable. \\nFinancially stable: \\nFinancial stability is a form of future insurance. Although I pride myself in being as financially independent as I can reasonably be, liking someone who could also do the same provides a sense of security. \\nI’m not a gold digger, trust me. \\n\\nOnce I got back to Canada, I spent a brief time liking you, while knowing that it was all completely infeasible. It was hard to get those summer days out of my mind, and hard to move onto other people at the same time. I questioned if I would meet someone who I thought was as cool, smart, and beautiful as you were. \\n\\nIt was a bit out of desperation, and also out of a groundless hope that I tried to remain relevant to you. I asked for artists and music that you were into, so I could listen to those and start conversations with you. I kept up to date with your stories of transferring into CS so you could be the person I remembered. I sometimes looked back at our trip photos so I could affirm myself that those summer days were worth it. \\n\\nThere’s even some evidence that remains today. Whenever I check my Spotify account, I see the artists I had saved onto my “Liked playlists” just so I could use the music you were into to get into kpop.  \\n\\nThough, note that Yerin Baek is not included, as she was the only artist I actually listened to. Spotify organizes your “Liked playlists” in the order where you last visit them, so “The Black Skirts” and “Yerin Baek” are further above in terms of relevancy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, around this time, I stopped talking to you. I felt as if I was being “walled” by you, as you’d take a long time to respond to my messages. I’d send you videos on Younha playlists, only to be eventually left on read and for our conversations to later die out. I felt frustrated and didn’t think that you thought I was relevant, which is why I decided to 90% move on. 90%, because I promised myself I would contact you if I were ever to land a job in SF, or head back to Daegu. \\n\\nIn retrospect, I’d still argue we were both justified. You were in a relationship, and I did the most reasonable thing you should do when someone doesn’t respond. As smart and pretty as you were, I couldn’t afford to keep chasing an imaginary girl at that point. I was slightly bitter, and I think this bitterness carried into when we next interacted. \\n\\nFast forward 8 months, and I was wrapping up my work term with Huawei. Though you wouldn’t know this, I had just failed to confess to another girl. I hated how I was speechless at the moment I wanted to confess, so I knew the next time I wouldn’t hesitate anymore. If you were to ever read this document, this is where I’d tell you the other girl is romantically irrelevant to me now. \\n\\nDo you still remember when a stranger in Daegu told you that he’d stay in touch with you, even as you moved around from place to place and never settled down? Though it was first said out of affection, now it remained in the back of my mind as a policy I should uphold for a friend. It was mostly for that reason that I decided to message you sometime again in April. “Mostly”, because a small part of me still hoped you’d think favourably of me. \\n\\nThis time, I asked if you were heading back to Daegu this summer, to which you said no. I was a bit disappointed, but at this point you were already “out of sight, out of mind”. We chatted a bit about the difficulty of finding jobs, and I thought little of it. I found myself engaging in a shallow conversation so I wouldn’t need to forget you again. \\n\\nUntil one day, on a certain day in May, you messaged me out of the blue on iMessage, asking if I’d like to work on a project together. The timing could not have been better. A candidate we wanted for the project had just backed out, stating that they weren’t interested in web development. We suddenly needed someone else to pick up the work that had to be done. I knew that I’d be overwhelmed, as I would be occupied with a part-time job. Someone’s support would be greatly appreciated, so I agreed with my dad to quickly check your skills before inviting you to join the project. \\n\\nYou’ve heard me say this before, but I hope I can now describe it better while saying it again. I never intended us to be anything more than coworkers when we first started working, and I think you noticed it too. I knew that I ran the risk of falling for you, and so I avoided holding conversations that would extend beyond formalities. I’d focus on the task at hand, hoping that we would both make the most out of each other by the end of this. Afterwards, I planned to congratulate myself on having done a favour for my friend, and quickly move on with my life. I didn’t want to fall for you again, and repeat a similar cycle as before. \\nYou told me that you felt as if I didn’t like you even as a friend anymore, and I apologize for that. I hope you can understand why, now. \\n\\nThen, you came to Canada. Behind the scenes, I was very frustrated with how my dad operated. For no reason, he was gambling that your offer would be out by the time you came to Canada, and so he set an arbitrary date for you to come after he had submitted your application to the university. I should’ve been prudent. I should’ve told him to delay purchasing a plane ticket until you had received the offer letter. \\n\\nOnce you came, I planned on treating you with the same level of shallow professionalism I had shown in the past. I envisioned us as pure coworkers, with nothing more than a business relation. However, what threw me off was on our first day when you began talking about your exes. At that point I began realizing I still liked you, given how stupid I thought your exes were. Are they blind? Are they dumb? Why would they do something so stupid to such a lovable person? After days of deliberation on whether or not your exes were right, I concluded that they were wrong, and the previous me knew better than they did. \\n\\nIronically, talking about your exes made me into you. Would you look at that. \\n\\nIn Canada, I didn’t admit to myself that I liked you until the day you left. Before then, I was mentally roleplaying both an excellent host and also a partial boyfriend. On the one hand, I was determined to repay the kindness you showed me in Daegu while removing all remaining obligations between us. On the other hand, having changed a lot after last dating 5 years ago, I was personally curious on how I would treat a hypothetical SO. \\n\\nMy experiment succeeded a bit too well. It may have been roleplay at first, but somewhere my mental boundaries broke down and I had to re-enter my mental separation phase. I’ve got another coping document dedicated to that, but it’s pessimistic in nature and unsuitable for a love letter. It’s a document I want but don’t want to show you. \\n\\nI was beyond happy when we remained in contact after you left. Though it was a given, since our project had yet to finish, I began looking forward to our checkins despite the time commitment of finals. I wanted to involve myself in your life, whether it was through looking at Gitlet or reading your BYOW project description. At some point, I promised myself I’d confess to you, successfully, once our project ended. \\n\\nDuring that time, I began to learn more and more about you. While some of the reasons I liked you remained the same, some new ones were added as well. I learned more about you as a person; your struggles with mental health, sleep, and still your persistence in achieving your goals. It pained me whenever you talked about your misfortunes in life, such as the plagiarism accusation, your incompetent project partner, your garbage exes, your parents’ mistreatment of you, the stresses you endured in high school, your sacrifices you’ve made for your family. I was happy when you talked about your successes in life, such as the successful adjudication process, your hopes in the upcoming exams, and the sleep you achieved on a day to day basis. I wholeheartedly wished that life would begin going the way you wanted it to. I felt more and more obligated to confess given all the wrongs you’ve experienced in life. If I could even help you a bit I would be glad to do so. I wanted you to fully experience your university life and beyond, free of life’s added stresses and insecurities. \\n\\nBefore I confessed, here were the reasons I liked you:\\nPersistence:\\nYou mentioned that what motivates you in life is all the past adversities you’ve faced. I admire how persistently you’ve lived your life, and how you’ve gotten past the troubles you’ve faced in your life. \\n\\nKindness: \\nYou acted in great consideration for me while we were in Canada. You’d stay awake in the car to talk to me as I drove, you paid for karaoke even when I was hosting, and you always seemed mindful of what I was doing. \\nYou’re also too nice to your family members. Even though you have your issues with both your parents, you still call them from time to time. Your mom relies on you heavily, which is a good indication of your character. \\nYou kept encouraging me to sleep more, or study more. The times that you did, I did find that my focus greatly improved. \\n\\nCommon interests: \\nThough we already found out in Daegu, we both enjoy playing TFT. You also seem open to baseball, which is an automatic super-green flag for me. We also share a similar taste in Korean music (not sure about other languages), and your singing voice is simply too good. \\n\\nSmart/funny/pretty/etc:\\nI can’t remember how often we’d be talking, and I’d make note of how smart you were, or how much I’d laugh, or how I’d catch myself staring at you. But there’s not much to say here, as I think you should know just as well as I do. \\n\\nMedicated personality:\\nWhenever you call me while medicated, you become bold yet bubbly. Hearing it makes me feel as if I’d be willing to do anything for you. \\n\\nDeep personality:\\nYou’re nice to talk to, and I think part of it is because your personality is multidimensional. You have moments where you’re strict, rational, and determined, but also moments where you’re curious, humble, and unguarded. I can’t predict your next thoughts and actions, which makes each word you say worth so much more. \\n\\nIt’s hard to write a conclusion for this document. Part of me wishes that I won’t need to stop writing pages of why I like you. I wish I could get to know you more and more, so why would we need a conclusion for that? \\n\\nAt the same time, reality is harsh as is. As we agreed in our more recent, longer calls, it’s important to look at the situation with a realistic lens. Our schedules and physical distances are too far apart, and the lives ahead of us are long and undefined. \\n\\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I think it was best for us to remain as friends. It felt awkward liking you in “friends plus”, and long distance seemed like a different issue. If our times never happen to cross again, then the least I can say is I'm happy to have met you. I wish you the best, and I know we’ll both find our ways in the future.\"),\n",

It’s because you toldme that two bottles of sokju was your limit, and I wanted to ex[erience why exactly you felt that way. I wanted to know why two bottles was your limit, and so I drank two bottles without a second thought. Honestly, I am so obsessed with you right now. You can’t imagine how fast I amd typing these drunken tests. Like im sure that if you were next to me right now, you’d be surprised with how fast my touch typing skills were. Speaking of that, I think your linear algra skills need to improve. I think that it’s pretty dmb howyou were unable to solve a linear system with two unlknownsl . how up lt me type to kevin for a second Ihope I don’t become an alcoholic in the future. Do you know that before typing tohis I searehd up so many things as to not become an alcoholic? This is how much I care for myself, and I think you should follow the same way. Just look at this \\n\\n\\n\\nOI hope that got an image of how drunk I am but I’m sure that tells you the point. \\n\\nAnyways, Ahslye, I like you so much. I think you’re soo pretty, and I think our personalities are compatible. EVerytime I’m without you, we’re able to laugh so much. WE’re able to play so much tdt, and I think that brings me so much joy in life. Although I can feel that I’m becoming sover now, I just want to tell you that the games of tft that we played today were so fun. I want to see you hit plat, even if it means I will throw up. \\n\\nYou know, I think I’m borderline obsessed with you right now. I was watching the cars that pulled into building 5-9/’5-8 today, i hopethat one of the cars was your dad’s\\n\\nYou know, in truth I hoped that I wouldn’t meet your dad. How would I be able to face him? How would I be able to tell him that I liked hisdaughter?\\n\\nIt’s actually crazy right now. THere’s a ball is professor peng’s office, and I can’t tell if it’s one ofjwcta or two objects\\n\\nMy entire bosy is fuzzy. MAybe I should drink more next time as to reveal MRIE of my true feelings\\n\\nWhiel I \\\\;m here I should reveal more thoughts about my dad.\\n\\nJust kidding, Iwon’t. \\n\\n\\nWhy would I do that\\n\\nI like him so much, and he;s done so much for me, ALogn with professor peng. \\n\\nYou know, what if Iaccidentally share this to you by the end of this? I really don’t know what’s happening anymore, I’m just letting my thoughts rub wild. Let me send you a photo of just how much I’ve drank. I hope I don’t throw uplater . \\nLi\\n\\nOKa according to my phone it was sent further above. \\n\\nI think I will send this document to my two friends. They mean so much to me, and I think it will be fun for them to see as I type my pure drubnken thoughts. Here leemme do that real quick. Although ashlye, trust me, it won’t be like this in the future, I’ll be completely for you. Anyways here I go. \\n\\n\\nOK I shared it with them, but I’ll revoke it later.\\n\\nWhy am I doing this? Well, I think they are my better voice of reason. The soju may be bitter but their reminder of reality ismore important to me. They are what keeps me grounded, and reasonable. \\n\\nBut do note that on the night we were reasonable, I’m positive they were both sleepihng.\\n\\nI truly regret nothing on the night we decided both be reasonable, and to abadoon friends plus. I think this is the most important part of the document\\n\\nYou see, I don’t think it was feasible in the first place. (there is a spectator on the docu right now, so idk how my words will change). For some reason, the idea of exclusivity haunted me. I didn’t want you to be locked into another partner, and I didn’t want myself to be locked into you as well. IT felt suffocating to be locked into each other even though we haaven’t started dating each other yet. \\n\\nLike, the moment you told me someone else had asked you out, I truly dind’t know what to say. I’m actually happy for you. I’m happy that the girl I liked has someone else that likes her. And I know that she;ll be happier if it was without someone that wasn’t me. I know that she deserves the best in the world, beaacuse of all the tough tiems she’s had in life. I really just wish the best for you, 100%. Even in a drunken state, I’m at a lost for words right now. The only reassurance I have is that maybe I will never share you this doc. It doesn’t matter that kevin might be spectating me as I type right now. There are things that are more important, and things that truly matter. \\n\\nIn fact, this should be a once in a lifetime privilege for him, as what kind of dumabss friendwould typ eall their honest thoughts in a doc while inviting them to check him out? I really am such a fool, am I. Even with my >100wpm, I’m able to type bs all the same.\\n\\n\\nDo you see these 5 pages I’m typing girth now? I know that by the time I finish this rant, or whatever you call itm I know it will be fivepages long. I know that when I wrote the five page document, at first I was completely honest. I was also completely hoenst  at the ejd. I really like you, you know. But anyways. Those 5 pages are absolutely priceless. Do you even know how many girls I ‘ve written those 5 pages for? They spent me hours of work, even if those hours were spent during dead time, I just hope you can see how I feel, and realize how much I’d be able to provide  and how much emotion I would dedicate for you. It must be special, because I usually don’t dediceate this much emotion to anyone.\\n\\nDo you see the image of the osju that I had attached earlier? Do you know why I got it? Ot’s because my dumbass forgot which one you liked more. I’m 90% sure you like the one with the boomer looking label more, but it’s also why I drank it first.\\n\\nAs an aside, I think that alcoohoilism is a negative feedback loop. More alcohol just makes drinkign additional aocjhol worse. I shouldkeep thi sin midn when drinking alcoljhol in the future. You dont understand, but it’s so ahrd to keep my head straight right now. I don’t even know if the words I’m typing are coherent or not, but it doesn’t actually matter. I’m sure you’ll figure out what I mean.\\n\\nEven now, I know that professor peng is staring me from the table int he living room wondering WTF is this guy doing. Well, to answer your \\tquestion, I’m doing this for you.\\n\\nI think there’s a good chance that you don’t like me, and there’s a good chance that you’ll never like me. I think my stance on that I’ll be a stalwart supporter remains the same. In the future, if we dpn’t get together, I think I’ll move on, and devote my heart to someone else. With my monogamy policy, I think it means that I will also stop liking you (blasphemous, isn’t it). But even will, I think at this point in my life I am willing to support you wherever I go, EVen if its a stupid ass question asking about how I would solve a system of linear equations, I still got you. Liek all the time and extra money that I am earning right now would be meaningless without you. \\n\\nSave for spme pf the mpoey I would allocate towards spending on my friends.\\n\\nThe aftertaste of alcohol in my mouth is bitter, but I think the outcome of this document is sweet. Maybe I will have created a masterpiece by the end of this, but maybe not at the sme time. \\n\\nNBere I’ll tel; you a funny story about how I drank these two bttoels of alcohol, it’s omething Id’ tel you without my consciousness but I think think by knowing this you’d knowhow much I’ like you. \\n\\nSo I first chose these two bottles exactly because I forgot what kidn of soju you liked. We were talking back from the grocery store and I just thought “hmm ashley likes one out of these two bottles”. So then I bought both brands, and drunk an entire bottle while on the shitter. \\n\\nI can’t say that drinking the bottle itself was truly memorable or not. It was just me chugging td out out of a 360 ml bottle. For reference, according to quora, that’s 4 drinks per bottle, so 8 drinks intotal. Anyways, I remembered that two bottles were your limit, so I just wanted to show you that “hey! I could also drink two bottles! Maybe we could be drinking buddies in the future!”. Anyways, I drunk that one 360 ml bottle alone in the washroom. I chugged it in one go. In my first minute, I didn’t know what was up. I just drank it for the sake of drinking it, and for the sake of writing this coping doc you see right now.\\n\\nYou know, I’m positive that when you see this, you’ll reject me right away. How can someone in this state of mind be your partner? Surely there’s got to be some underlying concerns with his health, or soemthing. \\n\\nMy dad is drying his hair next to me right now. I have no thoughts on it, besides that I think if he were to hold and extended conversation with me, I don’t know if I’d lash. Maybe I’d lash out, like a character in the books that I read, or maybe I’ll just stay chill, like the good kid that I usually am. But the trust remains the same. I have absolutely no clue what the fuck is going on right now. \\nI’m just enjoying how drunk I am, and documenting how it feel salong every stpe on the way. I know that maybe kevin is watching me right now, and maybe he can learn from me, which makes me happy. \\n\\nHere, kevin. Watch as “I take a piss in the toilet. Lemme show you how accurate I can be even when I am drunk. You’ll be impressed how I can maintain my composure under such alternatiJ\\nYeha she is in the ashropom right now. There is abpsltely no chase thztI can get up from my spot on the sofa right n-0w. \\n\\nYou know what, mayb eI’ll take a selfie to document this;. \\n\\nFrom now on, I’ll be a moron, so as to what quora sayas, (plese upload)\\n\\nYou knwo what’s fcraxy, in the images I took just now, I did not give two shits to as to how I looked.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'Copy of 5 pages and more', 'date': '2023-08-28T12:16:03.073Z'}, page_content=\"Ashley once told me that she wanted to see 5 pages of why someone liked her, if anyone was to confess to her. This task is a bit challenging, as even now I still have many doubts. Nonetheless,I think I’ll be able to produce a 5 page love letter with all the thoughts that’ve been running through my mind lately.\\n\\nI think this document will be a bit different from the ones I usually write. My usual google drive of “coping docs” are not meant for anyone else to see, but this doc is something I intend to eventually share with Ashley if the right time ever comes. I’ll still do some light proofreading, but as far as my coping docs go, this document will be my thoughts alone, and written with little revision. \\n\\nAs a final preface, I think my feelings are a bit more complicated than just pure “liking”. I think I will separate this document into 2 sections: a public and a private section. Similar to OOP, haha. There are some thoughts that just don’t belong in a love letter, while some others that do. Regardless, both documents will be my honest thoughts. \\n\\nThis will be the 5 page document that she’s been looking for, though it’s possible she’ll never see it. I’ll have some fun writing this.\\nIt really hasn’t been that long since I first met you in Daegu.Though it’s only been a little over a year, in my mind it feels like it’s been so much longer. \\n\\nI think I can explain this with something you always say: “Out of sight, out of mind”. We’ve spent so much time apart within this past year that everything I did last summer feels a bit like a distant dream. My mind would never expect that just one year ago, I’d be meeting someone who I currently believe to like so much. \\n\\nI think this letter will be a bit similar to the call when I first confessed. I’ll go over all the events that have occurred starting from that summer and up until now. And along the way, I hope you’ll be able to realize all the reasons for why I like you. But of course, I’ll also guide you along and state certain reasons explicitly. \\n\\n****************************\\n\\nLeading up to when I first met you, I can’t say that I had the purest of intentions. At a certain lunch meeting between our dads, your dad had brought up the idea that I should meet you. At that time, with my soaring confidence and a certain degree of cockiness, I thought your dad was trying to offer you to me. \\n\\nI think that was part of the reason why when I first met you, I said: “you’re shorter than I thought”. When I think back to that moment, I can’t help but be mad at myself. At that time, I thought that since height wasn’t important to me, it wouldn’t be important to others as well. If I could, then I would give my past self a firm slap for saying that, and for making those assumptions. \\n\\nWhile it’s romantic to say that I fell in love when you were taking me around Daegu, life is neither as perfect nor as simple as you might think. Rather, I want to say the reason I liked you came from as much as can be shared within two afternoons. In our brief time together, I liked that you were:\\nPretty \\nPretty introverted\\nSmart\\nFunny\\nHardworking\\nFinancially stable\\n\\nBefore reading into each bullet point, keep in mind that these were my thoughts only after meeting you once. Meaning, they are shallow in nature: \\nPretty:\\nYour IG pfp was pretty, and you looked even better when I met you in person. It felt like I was being reverse-catfished. \\nIntroverted:\\nI liked the cute, sheepish, but also prideful way you were showing me around Daegu.\\n\\nI think I may have a thing for introverted girls.\\nSmart: \\nYou go to Berkeley.\\nFunny: \\nWhen you spoke of your beliefs, you spoke in a firm but blunt way. I think I’m into that. \\nHardworking:\\nI misunderstood that you did 2 extra years of highschool just to get into the university that you wanted to. While we later cleared that misunderstanding, this was the core reason I fell for you. I value effort above all else, so seeing such a dedicated display of effort was something that appealed the most to my values.\\nYou were driven to transfer into CS, which I thought was very admirable. \\nFinancially stable: \\nFinancial stability is a form of future insurance. Although I pride myself in being as financially independent as I can reasonably be, liking someone who could also do the same provides a sense of security. \\nI’m not a gold digger, trust me. \\n\\nOnce I got back to Canada, I spent a brief time liking you, while knowing that it was all completely infeasible. It was hard to get those summer days out of my mind, and hard to move onto other people at the same time. I questioned if I would meet someone who I thought was as cool, smart, and beautiful as you were. \\n\\nIt was a bit out of desperation, and also out of a groundless hope that I tried to remain relevant to you. I asked for artists and music that you were into, so I could listen to those and start conversations with you. I kept up to date with your stories of transferring into CS so you could be the person I remembered. I sometimes looked back at our trip photos so I could affirm myself that those summer days were worth it. \\n\\nThere’s even some evidence that remains today. Whenever I check my Spotify account, I see the artists I had saved onto my “Liked playlists” just so I could use the music you were into to get into kpop.  \\n\\nThough, note that Yerin Baek is not included, as she was the only artist I actually listened to. Spotify organizes your “Liked playlists” in the order where you last visit them, so “The Black Skirts” and “Yerin Baek” are further above in terms of relevancy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, around this time, I stopped talking to you. I felt as if I was being “walled” by you, as you’d take a long time to respond to my messages. I’d send you videos on Younha playlists, only to be eventually left on read and for our conversations to later die out. I felt frustrated and didn’t think that you thought I was relevant, which is why I decided to 90% move on. 90%, because I promised myself I would contact you if I were ever to land a job in SF, or head back to Daegu. \\n\\nIn retrospect, I’d still argue we were both justified. You were in a relationship, and I did the most reasonable thing you should do when someone doesn’t respond. As smart and pretty as you were, I couldn’t afford to keep chasing an imaginary girl at that point. I was slightly bitter, and I think this bitterness carried into when we next interacted. \\n\\nFast forward 8 months, and I was wrapping up my work term with Huawei. Though you wouldn’t know this, I had just failed to confess to another girl. I hated how I was speechless at the moment I wanted to confess, so I knew the next time I wouldn’t hesitate anymore. If you were to ever read this document, this is where I’d tell you the other girl is romantically irrelevant to me now. \\n\\nDo you still remember when a stranger in Daegu told you that he’d stay in touch with you, even as you moved around from place to place and never settled down? Though it was first said out of affection, now it remained in the back of my mind as a policy I should uphold for a friend. It was mostly for that reason that I decided to message you sometime again in April. “Mostly”, because a small part of me still hoped you’d think favourably of me. \\n\\nThis time, I asked if you were heading back to Daegu this summer, to which you said no. I was a bit disappointed, but at this point you were already “out of sight, out of mind”. We chatted a bit about the difficulty of finding jobs, and I thought little of it. I found myself engaging in a shallow conversation so I wouldn’t need to forget you again. \\n\\nUntil one day, on a certain day in May, you messaged me out of the blue on iMessage, asking if I’d like to work on a project together. The timing could not have been better. A candidate we wanted for the project had just backed out, stating that they weren’t interested in web development. We suddenly needed someone else to pick up the work that had to be done. I knew that I’d be overwhelmed, as I would be occupied with a part-time job. Someone’s support would be greatly appreciated, so I agreed with my dad to quickly check your skills before inviting you to join the project. \\n\\nYou’ve heard me say this before, but I hope I can now describe it better while saying it again. I never intended us to be anything more than coworkers when we first started working, and I think you noticed it too. I knew that I ran the risk of falling for you, and so I avoided holding conversations that would extend beyond formalities. I’d focus on the task at hand, hoping that we would both make the most out of each other by the end of this. Afterwards, I planned to congratulate myself on having done a favour for my friend, and quickly move on with my life. I didn’t want to fall for you again, and repeat a similar cycle as before. \\nYou told me that you felt as if I didn’t like you even as a friend anymore, and I apologize for that. I hope you can understand why, now. \\n\\nThen, you came to Canada. Behind the scenes, I was very frustrated with how my dad operated. For no reason, he was gambling that your offer would be out by the time you came to Canada, and so he set an arbitrary date for you to come after he had submitted your application to the university. I should’ve been prudent. I should’ve told him to delay purchasing a plane ticket until you had received the offer letter. \\n\\nOnce you came, I planned on treating you with the same level of shallow professionalism I had shown in the past. I envisioned us as pure coworkers, with nothing more than a business relation. However, what threw me off was on our first day when you began talking about your exes. At that point I began realizing I still liked you, given how stupid I thought your exes were. Are they blind? Are they dumb? Why would they do something so stupid to such a lovable person? After days of deliberation on whether or not your exes were right, I concluded that they were wrong, and the previous me knew better than they did. \\n\\nIronically, talking about your exes made me into you. Would you look at that. \\n\\nIn Canada, I didn’t admit to myself that I liked you until the day you left. Before then, I was mentally roleplaying both an excellent host and also a partial boyfriend. On the one hand, I was determined to repay the kindness you showed me in Daegu while removing all remaining obligations between us. On the other hand, having changed a lot after last dating 5 years ago, I was personally curious on how I would treat a hypothetical SO. \\n\\nMy experiment succeeded a bit too well. It may have been roleplay at first, but somewhere my mental boundaries broke down and I had to re-enter my mental separation phase. I’ve got another coping document dedicated to that, but it’s pessimistic in nature and unsuitable for a love letter. It’s a document I want but don’t want to show you. \\n\\nI was beyond happy when we remained in contact after you left. Though it was a given, since our project had yet to finish, I began looking forward to our checkins despite the time commitment of finals. I wanted to involve myself in your life, whether it was through looking at Gitlet or reading your BYOW project description. At some point, I promised myself I’d confess to you, successfully, once our project ended. \\n\\nDuring that time, I began to learn more and more about you. While some of the reasons I liked you remained the same, some new ones were added as well. I learned more about you as a person; your struggles with mental health, sleep, and still your persistence in achieving your goals. It pained me whenever you talked about your misfortunes in life, such as the plagiarism accusation, your incompetent project partner, your garbage exes, your parents’ mistreatment of you, the stresses you endured in high school, your sacrifices you’ve made for your family. I was happy when you talked about your successes in life, such as the successful adjudication process, your hopes in the upcoming exams, and the sleep you achieved on a day to day basis. I wholeheartedly wished that life would begin going the way you wanted it to. I felt more and more obligated to confess given all the wrongs you’ve experienced in life. If I could even help you a bit I would be glad to do so. I wanted you to fully experience your university life and beyond, free of life’s added stresses and insecurities. \\n\\nBefore I confessed, here were the reasons I liked you:\\nPersistence:\\nYou mentioned that what motivates you in life is all the past adversities you’ve faced. I admire how persistently you’ve lived your life, and how you’ve gotten past the troubles you’ve faced in your life. \\n\\nKindness: \\nYou acted in great consideration for me while we were in Canada. You’d stay awake in the car to talk to me as I drove, you paid for karaoke even when I was hosting, and you always seemed mindful of what I was doing. \\nYou’re also too nice to your family members. Even though you have your issues with both your parents, you still call them from time to time. Your mom relies on you heavily, which is a good indication of your character. \\nYou kept encouraging me to sleep more, or study more.

As we agreed in our more recent, longer calls, it’s important to look at the situation with a realistic lens. Our schedules and physical distances are too far apart, and the lives ahead of us are long and undefined. \\n\\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I think it was best for us to remain as friends. It felt awkward liking you in “friends plus”, and long distance seemed like a different issue. If our times never happen to cross again, then the least I can say is I'm happy to have met you. I wish you the best, and I know we’ll both find our ways in the future.\"),\n",

However, must be a BFS traversal (as it might get the wrong parent if its DFS traversal) \\nIf restricted time:\\nIf you think hard enough, then at the moment you create each branch, you can create a data structure that stores the most recent ancestor of each branch. This table must be updated whenever a new branch is added (as it must support the combinations of every branch pair)  \\nIdea is that the most recent ancestor is the commit before the newly created branch. Proceeding branches can use data from the table table. \\nRequires more logic. Haven’t verified if the logic is sound, either. \\n\\nGet changes from MRCA to current head\\nReturn a list of strings indicating all the files that were changed from the MRCA files to the current head files. \\nGood luck detecting which files were changed.

Maybe to make this faster, you can indicate which filenames were changed in each blob’s metadata\\n\\n.Compare changes between heads using outlined table outcomes\\nUsing both lists of files returned from previous functions, compare these two lists and execute the according operation.\\nIs extremely mechanical. Watch the merge video and base it off the table. Should be reusing many functions you’ve made ie add, commit.\\nChatGPT output that might help you understand merge better: (It has the same idea as the project page description)\\n\\nGit merge is implemented using a three-way merge algorithm. The three-way merge algorithm combines the changes from two different branches, typically the current branch and another branch you want to merge into the current branch (often called the \"source\" and \"destination\" branches, respectively).\\n\\nThe basic steps of the three-way merge algorithm are as follows:\\n\\n1. Identify the common ancestor: Git finds the most recent common ancestor commit of the two branches involved in the merge. This common ancestor serves as the baseline for comparing the changes made in both branches.\\n\\n2. Retrieve changes from the source branch: Git determines the changes introduced in the source branch since it diverged from the common ancestor. It calculates the differences between the common ancestor and the tip of the source branch.\\n\\n3. Retrieve changes from the destination branch: Similarly, Git identifies the changes made in the destination branch since it diverged from the common ancestor. It calculates the differences between the common ancestor and the tip of the destination branch.\\n\\n4. Combine changes: Git combines the changes from both branches into a new \"merge commit.\" If there are no conflicts between the changes, Git can perform an automatic merge, applying all the changes from both branches cleanly. However, if there are conflicting changes, Git will mark the conflicting sections, and manual intervention is required to resolve the conflicts.\\n\\n5. Create a merge commit: Once all conflicts are resolved (if any), Git creates a new commit, known as the merge commit. This commit has multiple parents, representing the two branches being merged. It captures the merged state of the project, incorporating changes from both branches.\\n\\nThe merge commit forms a new point in the history of the destination branch, effectively integrating the changes from the source branch into it. This way, Git maintains a comprehensive history of how changes from different branches are combined over time.\\n\\nIt\\'s essential to remember that while Git\\'s automatic merge functionality is quite powerful and often works seamlessly, it might encounter conflicts that require manual resolution. In such cases, Git will prompt you to resolve the conflicts and then commit the changes to complete the merge process.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'a cope', 'date': '2023-07-07T16:36:17.807Z'}, page_content='It’s been two days since Ashley left. At first, I thought everything was alright. Though the drive home from the airport was more tiring than usual, I was able to regain my mental composure from singing ‘The Script’ songs alone in the car. I went home, dedicated 5 hours for myself to return to normal, then began studying for the Math239 midterm, which would be occurring the following day. \\n\\nIt must’ve been because I was just too busy to realize that those 5 hours I gave myself were not enough. These days have truly gone past in a blur. I drove home, studied, slept, woke up, went to class, studied, did my midterm, played badminton, talked with dad about the CP project next steps, then wrote 4 reports on 4 research papers before going to bed. During that time, I think I was just too busy to leave time for myself, which resulted in the state I am in now (in need of coming back to this google drive folder).\\n\\nMaybe it was partially because of the MATH239 midterm, which I choked badly on, that gives me so many reasons to cope. But I think it’s also because Ashley’s gone, and I’m only now realizing how happy I was during the time I spent with her. \\n\\nI’m still unsure why I like her. I’m convinced it’s all based on appearances, and so I’m not convinced it’s a sufficient reason to pursue her. But maybe it partially has to do with how I admire her work ethic, her bluntness, her humble composure, and just the amount of things we have in common. Maybe it’s a bit of all that. \\n\\nExcept, even if I like her, there’s nothing much that I should be doing right now. As her supervisor on this project, my number 1 goal is to deliver up to expectations with this project. I didn’t suggest her to this position because I still liked her. At that point, it was out of convenience and friendship, as she was the first to reach out whether I’d like to collaborate on a project with her. But now, what’s done is done, and the way I’m approaching this has changed by so much. I do hope that I can manage to balance all these outside expectations and inner desires to create a project that lives up to professional standards. This must be the reason why people are often told to separate friends + family from business. \\n\\nIt’s too much to say: “The days Ashley was here was when my thoughts on Waterloo completely changed. Before I had thought that Waterloo was such a boring city, but realizing that I could share my hometown with someone I both admire and like suddenly makes this city so much better than before”. It’s too much to say, because, maybe I had truly already forgotten/gotten accustomed to my surroundings. Maybe I had lost appreciation for the city I was living in. \\n\\nIn any case, the outcome is the same. Ashley tells me that she wishes she could live here, and that she enjoys it so much more than at Berkeley. I know these are just polite words from her to me, with maybe a hint of truth. But is it too wishful to ask for just more of those statements to be true? Is it too much to ask for more out of a “see you again?”. Just spending time with her has made me realize how much I’d be willing to dedicate for someone I like, and that maybe this is something I’d want in my life. (my declined credit card is screaming) \\n\\nI hope that in the future, whether it be with Ashley or not, I’d be able to find someone that I can form a healthy relationship with. Health should be above all else, as even the happy lifestyle I was living with while Ashley was here was not sustainable. With my current talent and assets, there are too many things that I lack. Frankly, when I compare myself with someone I think she deserves, I just don’t think things line up. Her family’s rich, and I can’t tell if they spent their money responsibly or not. I know that Ashley pays a lot to stay at Berkeley + her lifestyle in America. I know that she’s used to splurging at Daegu’s local mall, and that the price tag of an item is usually of lesser concern to her (who can afford to buy bottled dasani water on a daily basis and throw the bottle out, as if it wouldn’t need to be reused for the exact same reason). I think that if I want to allow her to continue living this standard of life, I should be working much harder than I am right now. I should be striving to provide as much, so I could live up to my impression of her standards. \\n\\nI remember that before she left, she sent me a text. It was a song recommendation that we had brought up beforehand, about a Younha song that had been stuck in her head. Though I haven’t yet searched the song’s English name nor the meaning of the lyrics, I’m told it’s a song about unrequited love. It’s a song about “I waited to say I like you but ended up not saying it and now I’m crying, or something along those lines”. At this point I must just be grasping at straws. Anyone who reads this would conclude that I am not in my right state of mind, and that a song is just a song; there’s nothing more to read into it. But even still, I live for the possibility that just maybe there’s the slimmest of chances that she likes me back. \\n\\nI think my current behaviour could be labeled as the textbook behaviour of a (something). When I look into myself, I don’t think this is a healthy sort of behaviour, and that this sort of relational imbalance will surely not lead to happiness in the future. At the end of the day, a relationship must be equal for it to last. I can’t help but feel slightly disappointed and disgusted at myself for feeling this way. It’s contradictory that I’m trying to improve myself for the sake of someone, by sacrificing time and capacity to worry over unrelated details. If I liked her, I would not think more than I need to. I would wrap up this project quickly (with quality), study for exams, secure high grades, secure a well paying job, and confess to her. I should stop being distracted for now, and save these worries for later. \\n\\nMoreover, I think my behaviour right now is similar to those types of people who would be “tier 3 subs” to Twitch streamers (simp). I’m getting happiness from doing something that is a loss to me, and daydreaming over the next time I’d get metaphorically stepped on. Even now, whenever the faintest trace of her scent passes by my nose, my mind goes into a sad frenzy, like a crackhead getting his daily dose. I hope in earnest that I will not be this kind of person in the future. For now, it’s fine. But in the future, I will be very disappointed in myself if this becomes my way of living. \\n\\nI should get my things together, for the sake of everyone who matters to me.'),\n",

Depending on your level of training by the time we begin working on the website, I will ask you to either recreate your own version of a data dashboard, or add new features onto the current one. \\n\\nThe reason why I believe the current website is inadequate is because of its flaws as an HMI application (search up “HMI developer”, for more info.). As well, I believe it is inadequate as a data visualization platform, and that it’s possible to achieve better results using 3rd party data visualization services rather than an in-house one. \\nDetailed HMI Display Design Principles | HMI Screen Design (realpars.com)\\n\\nMy proposed solution for the data visualization uses PowerBI, which is a data visualization tool developed by Microsoft. It is commonly used in data science, which fits in nicely with the degree you’re pursuing. However, as many things are still uncertain, let’s not get ahead of ourselves for now. I encourage you to explore alternative solutions to this problem while completing these tasks. \\n\\nIn my opinion, learning web development is not an easy feat. However, I think knowing the basics of web development is an essential skill to have. It’s something I believe is possible with enough determination and support. In that sense, feel free to send me any number of questions regarding web development, and I will be happy to answer.\\n\\nWith your affinities for both art and data science, I think this is a project with high potential for your future development. It’s not common that an internship will give you full creative rein, so I hope both you and I could make the most out of it. At the end of the day, I hope this can be a fruitful learning opportunity for you. \\n\\nBest, \\nAnthony'),\n",

The plaintiff in this case would be the port authority. The causes of action they could potentially pursue are:\\nNegligence (Professional?): The port authority could argue that Royal Caribbean (more specifically the Captain)  breached their duty of care towards the port's infrastructure by failing to safely dock the ship, resulting in damage to the port.\\nb. The best cause of action appears to be negligence. The legal elements to consider are:\\nDuty of Care: The cruise ship company owed a duty of care to the port authority to safely dock the ship without causing harm to the port. However, Royal Caribbean breached this Duty of Care as they caused harm to the port’s infrastructure.\\nStandard of Care: This is being labeled as the Ship Captain’s error, who assumes the most important role among the staff on the ship. Therefore, the Standard of Care for a Ship Captain is very high. However, the Captain failed to uphold the expected level of Standard of Care.\\nCausation: The breach of duty by the Royal Caribbean directly caused the collision and damage to the port's infrastructure.\\nDamages/Harm: The port authority suffered actual damages in the form of the destroyed pier structure and associated repair costs.\\n- Crashing into Falmouth port and causing damages because of pilot error\\n- driver was negligent and made an avoidable error causing damage to their property\\n- parts of infrastructure damaged and pier structure was crushed\\n- caused stress (yelling) to passengers of ship who were tourists in Jamaica, (large part of port’s business comes from tourists) and crash made a negative impact on tourists associations with Jamaica\\nDuty of care:\\nRelationship was the ship and the port.\\n\\nStandard of care: \\x0bShip is expected to safely dock at a port.\\n\\nSuffered injury/damage:\\nPort experienced damage.\\n\\nCaused plaintiff’s damage:\\nBoat driver’s error/mistake is what caused damage to the port.\\n\\nA.

As a result, an individual that has experience working with Linux and Raspberry Pis may find this setup easier to follow. Some improvisation is required as these instructions are followed. \\nBuilding the system:\\nFor detailed wiring instructions, refer to this document.\\n\\nAs seen above in Figure 1, the system consists of Nodes, an Edge, and a Cloud Server. To create the system from scratch, we will start by chaining Nodes and the Edge to each other. Our finished product (minus cloud) should resemble the setup shown below, in Figure 2. \\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Edge and Nodes\\n\\nWe can start by assembling each Node, as shown below in Figure 3:\\n\\nFigure 3: Node Setup\\n\\nFor each node, we want:\\n2 wlan interfaces\\n2 ethernet interfaces\\n1 RS-485 adapter\\nPower supply\\nAccompanying sensors\\n\\nWe use the Raspberry Pi’s USB ports to attach USB-Wifi adapters, USB-Ethernet adapters, and USB-RS485 adapters. A USB hub may be useful in case there are not enough USB ports. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional notes: \\nSetup is pretty flexible, as long as you satisfy the constraints above. \\nThe Node currently follows Modbus RTU communication protocol with the gas sensors. Related wiring must be done in accordance to Modbus (email anthony52ho@gmail.com for more information, if unclear)\\nNot all USB-Wifi adapters are suitable. Make sure the USB-Wifi adapter works for the Raspberry Pi. For my testing, this Brostrend Wifi adapter worked. Generally, adapters supporting “Linux” and “Raspberry Pi” are more likely to be supported. \\n\\nEdge setup is similar to Node, but simpler. It should be done according to Figure 4 below:\\n\\nFigure 4: Edge Setup\\n\\nFor the edge we want:\\n2 wlan interfaces (1 if internet comes via ethernet)\\n2 ethernet interfaces (1 if internet comes via wlan) \\nPower supply\\n\\n\\nTo complete the chain, we have to configure the software for both the Edge and Nodes. This allows each Raspberry Pi to utilize the physical connections we have just installed above. \\nEdge setup:\\nNote: Edge setup is more cumbersome, so bear with this procedure. \\n\\nConnect the Raspberry Pi to Wifi. \\nRun “git pull https://github.com/ant52ho/coop-project.git” in the “~” directory of the Raspberry Pi (paths are sensitive). \\nExecute the following commands on the command line (or create a shell script to do so):\\nNext, we have to initiate the database. This can be done with a shell script, but provided here is a manual method to enter on the command line\\ncd ~/coop-site/hardware/dhcp//home/pi/coop-project/hardware/dhcp/staticDHCPd/conf\\nsqlite3 dhcp.sqlite3\\nCopy/Paste the text located in “~/coop-project/setup/sqliteSetup.txt” into the prompt\\nEmail anthony52ho@gmail.com to create the script if necessary\\nNext, we configure the Raspberry Pi to run the serverScript on startup\\nEnter “chmod +x /home/pi/coop-project/hardware/startup/startEdge.sh” \\nEnter “crontab -e”. \\nChoose your code editor of choice (nano is easiest), and add this line to the bottom of the file: “sh /home/pi/coop-project/hardware/startup/startEdge.sh”\\n\\nNode setup:\\nConnect the Raspberry Pi to Wifi. \\nRun “git pull https://github.com/ant52ho/coop-project.git” in the “~” directory of the Raspberry Pi (paths are sensitive). \\nExecute the following commands on the command line (or create a shell script to do so):\\nNext, configure the Raspberry Pi to run the clientScript on startup\\nEnter “chmod +x /home/pi/coop-project/hardware/startup/startNode.sh” \\nEnter “crontab -e”. \\nChoose your code editor of choice (nano is easiest), and add this line to the bottom of the file: “sh /home/pi/coop-project/hardware/startup/startNode.sh”\\n\\nFinally, now that we’ve setup the hardware and the software for both Edge and Nodes, we need to connect it to the Cloud Server to store and display the data. \\n\\nI currently have an Amazon EC2 instance that hosts the website. This platform also stores the data, but I’m considering redeveloping it. There is likely no need for this section of the system to be changed, but I’ll nonetheless include all instructions for a setup from scratch: \\n\\nCloud Server setup:\\n\\nCloud server requirements: \\nConfigured Amazon EC2 server (email anthony52ho@gmail.com for details)\\n\\nInstructions:\\nRun “git pull https://github.com/ant52ho/coop-project.git” in the “~” directory of the Raspberry Pi (paths are sensitive). \\nExecute the following commands on the command line (or create a shell script to do so):\\nNext, configure the Raspberry Pi to run the cloudScirpt on startup\\nEnter “chmod +x /home/pi/coop-project/hardware/startup/startCloud.sh” \\nEnter “crontab -e”. \\nChoose your code editor of choice (nano is easiest), and add this line to the bottom of the file: “sh /home/pi/coop-project/hardware/startup/startCloud.sh”\\nHardware\\nThis section gives a brief description of all components of Raspberry Pi-related hardware.\\n\\nComponents: \\nNode: sensor data collection Raspberry Pis\\nEdge: sensor data transmitting Raspberry Pi\\nCloud: sensor data display service \\n\\nNode:\\nRefers to an individual Raspberry Pi. \\nIt is responsible for collecting sensor data and sending it to the edge.\\nCould also be referred to as a “station”\\nRuns clientScript5.py\\n\\nComponents:\\nBridging\\nEdge client\\nCollecting sensor data\\nEthernet messaging\\nWifi messaging\\n\\nBridging:\\n“Bridging” is a term in networking that is essentially data relaying\\nAn example of a bridge is a wi-fi extender, because it relays packets from its users to the internet, and vice versa\\nNote: This is an oversimplified (and technically inaccurate) description\\nThe tunnel monitoring system requires bridging to relay data between nodes.\\nThis is because in the tunnel, the nodes are connected in series. For data in the heart of the tunnel to be passed to the tunnel entrance, its information must travel through and be relayed by many other Nodes. \\nclientScript5.py establishes a bridge using numerous bash commands and the linux package “bridge-utils” \\nIf a Node is detected to have 2 ethernet interfaces, eth0 and eth1, then a bridge is created between the two interfaces\\nThe bridge is assigned the same IP as what the interface eth0 is already assigned\\nThe Node repeatedly checks whether it can form a bridge\\n\\n\\n\\nEdge client\\nA server is hosted on the edge computer/Raspberry pi. Each Node is a client of the edge server. \\nEdge clients are able to send strings to the edge server via a designated socket port. \\nNote: Both server and client will have to be running for messages to be sent between them. This is achievable by running “clientScript5.py” and “serverScript2.py” on client nodes and the edge server, respectively\\nData collection\\nThe Node collects data using a RS485 USB dongle, and daisy chaining the Pi and the nodes together in typical Modbus manner.\\nModbus requires that each sensor is assigned an ID. Furthermore, different sensors have different protocols for taking sensor readings. Therefore, sensors must be manually configured for the Node to appropriately collect data.\\nEthernet messaging\\nThe Node’s primary method of communicating is via its ethernet interfaces. At the minimum, each Node requires 2 ethernet ports to form the chain of Nodes, as seen in Figure 1. This is achievable via USB-ethernet adapters. \\nNodes are able to communicate with the Edge because the Edge assigns each Node an IP address. The IP address assignment is done with help of the staticDHCP Python library. \\nEthernet extenders may be required to physically link between Nodes, if there is a large physical separation between Nodes. \\n\\nWifi messaging\\nThe Node’s backup method of communicating is via its wlan interfaces. Each node requires 2 wlan interfaces, which is achievable via USB-Wifi adapters. \\nWifi messaging is composed of a redundant stream of strings. These strings are identical to the strings sent via ethernet messaging, but are tagged as “wlan”. \\nIn the event of an ethernet disconnection, Wifi messaging becomes the primary method of communication until ethernet communication becomes possible. \\nThe signal range of the Wifi adapters have not been tested. A repeater may be necessary to extend the signal of each Wifi adapter\\nThe Wifi messaging is built upon an Access Point/Client chain infrastructure. It is comparable to a chain of hotspots where Node 3 is connected to Hotspot 2, Node 2 is connected to Hotspot 1, etc…\\nAnother interpretation is to see the Edge as a Wifi router, and each Pi as a signal repeater that allows all connected devices to communicate to the edge. \\n\\nEdge\\nRefers to the Edge server, located at the edge of the tunnel\\nAssumed to have Wifi connectivity. \\nResponsible for relaying connected tunnel data to the Cloud. \\n\\nComponents\\nDHCP server (running + conf)\\nSQlite server\\nConfiguring the DHCP server for the first time\\nRedis server\\nEdge server\\nChecking connectivity\\nCloud client\\n\\nDHCP server\\nThe Edge features a DHCP server. This server allows Nodes to connect to the Edge and assigns IDs to the Nodes. \\nIs built using the staticDHCP Python library.\\nReassigns each Node with the same IP address by using the Node’s MAC address. \\nSQLite server\\nThe DHCP server stores Node IPs and MAC addresses inside an SQLite database.\\nMust be properly configured before use \\nThe DHCP server must be properly configured before use. \\n\\nRedis server\\nThe edge stores some dynamic variables such as “last Node” inside a Redis database\\nThis database is accessible by Nodes, and its variables are used by nodes.\\nCould be replaced in future implementations. \\nRequires a configuration file (configuration file is included in repository)\\n\\nEdge server\\nThe Edge opens two servers on two different Ports and IP addresses. They are collectively referred to as the “edge server” \\nOne port is for strings received via ethernet, while the second is for messages sent via wifi. \\nThe server receives and filters incoming strings sent from Nodes. \\nDistinguishes when there is an ethernet disconnection. Uses this distinction to control whether to forward strings sent from Nodes’ “ethernet” or “wifi” interfaces. \\nAfter filtering the received strings, the Edge forwards them to the Cloud server. \\nChecking connectivity:\\nThe edge server checks for connectivity by continuously pinging the furthest Node.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'Tunnel Sensors System Wiring Instructions', 'date': '2022-12-29T01:48:35.276Z'}, page_content='Tunnel Sensors System Wiring Instructions\\n\\nThis document outlines how to replicate the sensor wiring & configuration according to the lab setting. It is an extension of the report section “Building the System” from the included documentation.\\n\\nThere are two different sensors in use: the Viconox sensor and the Sensepoint sensor. Both sensors support a variety of communication methods, but this system focuses on using the Modbus RTU communication protocol. \\n\\nModbus RTU overview\\nI must admit I am not a Modbus expert, so there may exist better Modbus wiring configurations for this system. Nonetheless, the following application successfully uses Modbus RTU to poll sensor data from both types of sensors. \\n\\nModbus RTU follows a master-slave architecture, where the master (Raspberry Pi) calls upon the slaves (Sensors) to return data values. It accomplishes this, while only requiring a single master interface (RS485 port) via a daisy-chained system. This allows a large number of slaves (sensors) to be associated with a single master (Raspberry Pi) through, essentially, many devices wired in series. \\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Daisy chaining example\\n\\nThe diagram above makes careful distinction of the A and B wires. This is a property of establishing a daisy-chained connection, which we will see in the following sections. With this in mind, the following section explains how the Master (Raspberry Pi) is connected to the first slave (sensor):\\n\\nPi to Sensor connection:\\n  \\t\\t\\n\\nFigure 2: The USB-RS485 adapter \\n\\nThe above USB-RS485 dongle is used for Modbus communication between the Raspberry Pi and the sensor. Only 2 of the 5 pins are used, which are the A and B pins as labeled above. Of the remaining pins, 2 are ground pins while another is for 5V power. Additional details on the model used for testing can be found on Amazon. \\n\\nWiring is simple: \\nUse a screwdriver to open the pins that clamp down on the wire\\nInsert 2 wires into the “A” and “B” holes of the adapter\\nMake note of which wire enters which hole by designating one as the “A” wire and one as the “B” wire. \\nConnect the opposing end of the “A” wire to the “A” port of the sensor\\nConnect the opposing end of the “B” wire to the “B” port of the sensor\\n\\nMore information on the “A” and “B” ports of specific sensors will be covered in the next sections as they vary sensor-to-sensor. \\n\\nThe final product in our lab resembled Figure 3, as shown below:\\n\\nFigure 3: Pi to Sensor connection\\nAs seen in Figure 3, the RS485 adapter is plugged into the Raspberry Pi. A and B wires are identified and attached correspondingly to the sensor. \\n\\nNote that a modification was made (RJ45 connector) to the connection point between the wire and the sensor, but it can be interpreted as an extension of the original wire. The actual wire, whether an ethernet cable or something else, does not matter too much as long as it connects the Pi and the Sensor. \\n\\n\\nSensor connection: Sensepoint\\n\\nSensepoint sensors are one of the two sensor models that was experimented on in the lab. Information related to the sensor can be found in its documentation, sourced from its website. \\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Sensepoint board layout (pg. 9 of documentation)\\n\\nWiring instructions:\\nInsert the “A” wire in the “A” port\\nInsert the “B” wire in the “B” port\\n\\nThe final wired product in our lab resembled Figure 5, as shown below:\\n\\nFigure 5:  Sensepoint wiring in lab\\n \\nSensor connection: Viconox\\nThe Viconox sensor has two wiring requirements: Modbus and power. \\n\\nPage 20 of the Viconox Installation Manual contains useful tables and diagrams concerning the power and communications wiring of the Viconox sensor. The documentation is included in the zip folder that accompanies this document. \\n\\n\\t\\nFigure 6: Viconox Power and Comms wire\\n\\nModbus Wiring:\\nA photo is not available for the Viconox wiring, but the in-lab connection procedure was as follows: \\nUsing the table in Figure 6, the pink and grey wires were attached to an RJ45 head. \\nThe RJ45 head was joined onto the daisy chain.\\nIn the lab, we’ve delegated the last sensor of the chain to be the Viconox sensor. Otherwise, we would need to switch to a ‘backbone’ wiring topology (as opposed to our current daisy chain. \\n\\nModbus Power: \\n\\nFigure 7: Viconox Power\\n\\nUsing the table in Figure 6, the blue and brown wires were connected to a 24VDC power supply.\\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\nOur lab design resembled the setup shown below\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Complete sensor Wiring\\n\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me at anthony52ho@gmail.com'),\n",

I ended up just flexing on them with what ambitious plans I had for the Winter Break, and they laughed at me for typing my aspirations to be a part of something greater. My thoughts are that I should’ve just laughed it off without a second thought, instead of rushing to defend myself. But besides that, I’m happy I didn’t try taking back my words. I’m happy that I can take responsibility for my own words and back them up when required. \\n\\nAnyways, I was scrolling through instagram today when I encountered someone giving tips about how to improve your social skills. They were small things, such as tips to appear more confident, tips to establish an open self image, and tips to be a likeable person. After seeing those videos, I can say I’m intrigued to learn more. \\n\\nI don’t think I was ever great at socializing. I think it might be the case of becoming too self conscious, similar to how the more nervous someone gets, the worse they may often perform. In mine and possibly many others’ cases, I think it’s because we ruminate too much over social interactions, and end up acting awkwardly in an attempt to not act awkwardly. I’d like to improve myself in this aspect, and I think watching some videos are the best place to start. I’m on co-op right now, there aren’t any pressing issues at hand (besides CP stress and Huawei job), and I’ll be able to use these social skills on a daily basis with my cherished coworkers. \\n\\nOn another note, something that made me happy yesterday was when I called my grandpa yesterday, and he picked up immediately. I think I want to call him more now because it brought me a lot of satisfaction doing something my dad and I keep telling myself to do. And also, having someone that could hear you express whatever you want also feels comforting. \\n\\nWhat’s also comforting is how well Jessie and my dad got along on my birthday weekend. Jessie voluntarily learned differential equations on back-to-back days with my dad, without giving any sort of attitude. She would occasionally mention what someone might see as delicate subjects, such as suicide or transferring programs, to which my dad would respond maturely and with sincerity. They interacted in such a genuine manner that I was just shook to my bone. I really hope that they can get along like this more often, because it’s just like how they were when we were all younger. \\n\\nIn some way, I believe that deep inside, they both wanted to get along with each other more. With each of them privately, they had both expressed wanting to get along with the other many, many times. Sometimes, Dad would ask me how Jessie was doing while giving off an indifferent tone. Now thinking back, he would pass along questions such as “How’s Jessie doing lately? (in Chinese)” and “The reason I have not given up on her yet is because I am her father”. He would say these sentences in either a solemn or passive tone, giving off the impression that he’s given up. Jessie, on the other hand, would often claim that she wishes to get along better with my father, yet seemingly forget her convictions whenever the moment came. In this recent, rare moment where they got along so well, I could only wish that they continued this way. \\n\\nI think all three of us are needy people, and that we need each other fundamentally. As corny as it sounds, I think it comes from the aspect of being a family. I had always thought of myself as being more free-spirited and rebellious-at-will, but experiencing this was enough to confirm to myself where my allegiance lies. I sincerely hope that the three of us get along in the future just as well. \\n\\nIt might sound like I’m excluding mom from the picture, so I should preface that it is not the case. It’s just that my dad and my sister haven’t gotten along in such a long time, and being the self-centered person I am, I’d want to make their events part of my own as well. \\n\\nI must admit that I’m still uneasy around mom’s boyfriend Lionel, however. I hope he treats her well. \\n\\n\\nHappy 20th (+3 days), Anthony.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'My thoughts on my 2022 Taiwan trip', 'date': '2022-07-04T08:26:38.799Z'}, page_content=\"It feels a bit unreal. Sometime last year I told myself it’d be the last time I’d be revisiting Taiwan for the next 4-5 years. I had expected not to revisit this god-tier island until much later into the future, once I had graduated. Instead, here I am, looking outside the window at the Taoyuan T1 A4 gate, wondering if this time would be the momentarily last time I do come here. \\n\\nTaiwan was amazing this time. I got all my work done, and got a taste of independent freedom near the end of my trip. It felt liberating to experience the late-night Tamsui/Xindian bike rides, and visit different parks on my own. I tell myself that this is all for my own self pleasure, as well as my future companion’s pleasure once I bring someone to tour in Taipei. \\n\\nI still am a little regretful, however. I wish I treated the grandparents just a little better, and sooner recognized how thoughtful they are when it comes to me. They would constantly take care of me, asking if I felt alright if I sneezed, asking about my immediate plans, and dedicating some days to accommodating my preferences. I wonder if this is how it feels to be a part of a real family. I felt from grandma and grandpa a sense of caring that I must have forgotten I received as a child. I felt more in tune with my friends’ families with the level of care dedicated towards one person. This makes me regretful, because had I only realized this sooner and more actively, I’d have liked to return the same level of care and compassion for the two of them. I do hope that I may see both of them again, even if it may take me some time to return to Taiwan. \\n\\nOne of my plans should be to communicate with them more often on Line. In the worst case this is the last time I do see them, it would be a great way to demonstrate my maturity and show my affection to them. Especially because they had supported me in a way I think no one ever has. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, I don’t think I got out of this trip what I had first expected. My first expectations of Taiwan was a place of self-indulgence, labour, and independent development. However, as I am leaving, I think what I instead obtained was a heighted worth of family. The days I spent here weren't entirely about me. At times it did feel that way, but my every act of self-indulgence was met with support, acknowledgement, or accommodation from my grandparents. I believe this is what changed my opinions on them so profoundly. I truly wish them the best. \\n\\nTo follow my grandparents wishes, here are some notes that they had mentioned while I was here:\\nGrandma:\\nBecome interested in more things, beyond just video games.\\nStudy hard, and make friends.\\nGrandpa: \\nI’m not entirely sure. I suppose I’ll try making him proud with good grades.\\nRead books, become more acquainted with the world. \\n\\nI’m going to go search for things i can read on the plane.\"),\n",

Maybe I’ll put them on my website someday, or maybe I won’t because they might be too sensitive. For some reason, writing these just gives me a momentary sense of accomplishment that comes without much effort, and maybe publishing these onto my website would give me an extra sense of validation for the work I’ve currently done.\\n\\nThis Winter break, I think I’ve experienced… some things. I don’t think I did quite as much as Kevin did, seeing that he’s reportedly meeting many friends and going to the gym. The lifestyle I’ve been living, as I’ve explained to Kevin, is a perpetual motion machine of TFT, webcomics, and sleep. \\n\\nI feel like after so many iterations of the same routine, I’ve gotten a little tired of it. It can’t be possible that I miss school work that much, but doing nothing in my life just feels like such a waste. You know, one of my theories is that because I’m entering my prime, I’ve suddenly gained an increasing desire to become something greater. Maybe: design a web app, design a chrome extension, develop my employable skills, learn  some pytorch, and etc. \\n\\nIt’s for that reason, and also the fear of getting fired, that I recently started learning how to code pytorch. I can’t say I’m any expert as of yet, and that my opinions would be anything but valid, but it’s been an enjoyable process so far. For so long, I’ve observed the realm of machine learning from a distance. I’ve already watched a bunch of videos on machine learning basics, and even applied to a couple data science jobs. With all this pent up desire, it feels great to finally release it into the tutorials I’ve been following. Of course, I can’t stop here, right? It’d be lame to be done with data science after following this tutorial.\\n\\nYet, at the same time, I feel like data science is a little… limited. The best methods to solve certain tasks, such as loss functions for binary classifications multi-class classifications and whatnot have already been determined. Since this is the case, what left is there to do?\\n\\nMaybe this could be explained by the concept of jobs we learned in OB this past term. It’s possible that data science is a “disjunctive” field, and that the individual that comes up with the best results ends up doing it on behalf of everyone else. \\n\\nYesterday, I skimmed over an interesting article on slow learners. Apparently, it’s been studied whether slowness is attributable to intelligence. All the websites that appeared on the front page of google said that slowness and comprehension lag doesn’t necessarily imply stupidity, but I’m sure they’re just lying, in the same sense that men’s health websites claim that the average penis length is 5 inches. I’d imagine that only people who are concerned about their learning rate would use the same search terms as I did. And really, if the reality is that these individuals are just stupid, what else can you tell them? Should you tell them to just give up, since someone likely can do it better than them? Of course it wouldn’t be ethically sound, so those front page sites have but the choice to share that it’s ok to be slow. I’d like to end this thought by saying I personally think I’m dumb as bricks, but I use my effort to make up for it. \\n\\nReturning to my winter break, I currently find myself in Hagey Hall, with my eyes mostly closed and currently touch-typing this. This environment is pretty relaxing. Younha’s playlist is blasting in my ears and the large windows with great natural lighting are just above me. Moreover, it’s quiet, especially since everyone’s home for the Winter break. \\n\\nThere’s really no reason why I wrote this journal entry. At first, I thought it’d be very cliched but poetic to write an entry celebrating my resolutions and goals for the new year. But after some thought, that kind of person is just not me. I don’t mean to be edgy, but others’ events have just never made much sense to me. But of course, I am grateful for the break regardless of whether I understand it or not. \\n\\nIn the end, I think I wrote this journal entry because I’m procrastinating from the work I’m neglecting. I was originally here to get some work done, but rather I’m writing this as a means to “warm up my fingers”. Well, to preface, at ~800 words typed, my fingers better be warm.\\n\\nLet’s make this journal entry worthy by finally stating my purpose for the day. \\n\\nToday, at UW, I will:\\nUpdate my website\\nWork on previous coop project\\n\\nSince goals and tasks must be specific, i’ll further elaborate what I will specifically do:\\n\\nWebsite:\\nAdd backgrounds for each of the projects I have done on my website. \\nAdd Intro pytorch projects and this year’s C++ final project onto my website\\nBonus: Create additional pages for each work term’s activities\\n\\nPrevious coop project:\\nFigure out AWS EC2 run script without being logged in. \\nFix status messaging and information interference from clientscript. \\n\\nI’ll be copying these into my W23 to do list!'),\n",

If users may modify the stack, then the stack order would not be invariant. \\nCan enforce invariants by putting them in private. \\n\\nIterator rationale:\\nWhen dealing with abstractions, you may not want the client to have access to the underlying pointer. Ie. the object might be private, and you want them to strictly use the interface functions to interact with them. \\nTo help them access underlying lists, you can use an iterator. \\nIterators:\\nIterators are like gettors for every single item in the iterator object that contain gettors to the next item o.o\\nMust contain: iterator constructor, overloaded dereference (*) operator, overloaded ++ operator, and overloaded == and != operators. \\nParent class must contain: pointers to first and last iterator for comparisons. \\n\\nIterators and auto:\\nFor (auto it = l.begin(); it != l.end(); it++) {...};\\nFor (auto n : lst) {...}; \\nFor (auto &n : lst) {..};\\nNote that for modifications use the reference, because otherwise it is just a copy. \\n\\nFriends:\\nUseful for iterators because they need to access the private fields of the encapsulating class. \\nDeclaring class A as a friend of B means A has access to the private fields and methods of B\\n\\nUMLs: the different relationships:\\n“Owns a” - rep with black diamond\\n“Has a” - rep with empty diamond \\nIf something owns something, then it is responsible for deleting it\\n\\nObject slicing:\\nOccurs in inheritance when we convert a subclass pointer into a superclass pointer, and dereference the original subclass object. \\nBecause the subclass object has additional fields relative to the superclass, but the superclass pointer only knows to retrieve memory for the superclass, some fields get cut off. \\nCan resolve by making something virtual, so that when a superclass ptr is dereferenced, it instead references the underlying subclasses memory. \\n\\nPolymorphisms and arrays:\\nNever use arrays of objects polymorphically. Instead, for polymorphic arrays, use pointers. \\nThis is because the array assumes it is taking the size of the superclass. \\n\\nDestructors and polymorphism:\\nThe superclass dtor needs to be virtual because of the object destruction sequence. \\nRecap Destruction sequence: Subclass dtor body runs, subclass fields deinit in reverse order, superclass dtor runs, memory is reclaimed\\nIf the superclass doesn’t have a destructor, ie. it is pure virtual, then it cannot run. \\nYou can put a “final” next to your class name, ie public subclass final : public superclass to indicate that you can’t subclass further. \\n\\nConcrete vs. abstract classes:\\nAbstract: classes with a pure virtual method. Cannot be instantiated (hence abstract)\\nConcrete: classes that implement all pure virtual objects. Can be instantiated\\n\\nPolymorphic copy/move:\\nRegular copy ctor: regular MIL initialization. Done in MIL.\\nCopy assignment: copies fields using superclasses’ copy operator= on super fields, then special field individually\\nMove assignment: copies fields using superclasses’ move operator= on super fields, then special field individually. Triggers the move operator= by passing in the super obj as an rvalue using std::move(other).\\nStd::move forces something to be treated as an rvalue\\n\\nOverriding operator=:\\nComplicated\\nPossible, but rather not. Just make superclass abstract\\n\\nTemplates: \\nSyntax: template <typename T> class Stack{}...\\nAbove is a stack that works for all types T. \\nUsage: ie vector<string> something\\n\\nVectors:\\nPretty cool, support the iterator abstraction\\nIe.c can apply v.begin, v.end. \\nCan apply for (int i : v) {} ie if v is a vector\\n\\nExceptions: \\nExceptions are thrown through an unwound stack until it is caught. \\nAdvised to throw your own classes. \\nWhen rethrowing, just do “throw”.\\nRemember to catch by reference \\nNever let a destructor return an exception because then the object isn’t fully destructed\\n\\n\\nTemplates:\\nWork by generating definitions as each new type is passed in\\n\\nFactory method pattern:\\nVirtual constructor\\n\\nTemplate method pattern:\\nSince virtual gives the subclass a lot of power, a template method pattern allows superclasses to enforce subclasses only customize a certain portion of the behaviour\\nIe in the shell example, because red Turtle is only allowed to draw the shell, there’s no way it would draw other parts of the turtle. \\n\\n\\nNon-virtual idiom:\\nAll public methods should be non-virtual. \\nAny methods that are virtual should be made private or protected. \\nIe in the media player example, public method play() invokes the virtual method doPlay(). This way, the public method is non virtual and the virtual method is protected/private. \\n\\nVisitor pattern:\\nFor implementing double dispatch (deciding what method to call based off of two polymorphic types)\\nIe. e->bestruckby(w) is not enough, because what enemy are you striking with what weapon? \\nSubclasses can realize the underlying e-> pointer, but the w pointer is still ambiguous. \\nStrategy: make use of “this”:\\ne->bestruckby(*w) calls w.strike(*this), and in w.strike() we can account for all the possible enemies it might take in\\nAnother way of thinking of it: In weapon, we want varying efficacy depending on the target. We can first implement these two designs by having identical (in name) functions take in different fields. When an enemy is hit by a weapon, all we have to do is run one of the first 2 functions while passing in the enemy pointer as an ID. \\n\\nPimpl Idiom:\\nSaves recompile time. \\nNormally, when changes are made to a header file then all sources including it needs to be recompiled. \\nPimpl: hides the implementation in the headers, and includes an interface file that compiles immediately. \\nTechnique to separate implementation from interface.\\nKeep all private members in the implementation object. \\nClass definition in header file is the public interface of the class. \\nWorks if you don’t intend on changing the public interface, but intend on changing the private interface. By separating the two, changes to the private interface would be reflected publicly. \\n\\nMinimizing “includes”:\\nJust think from a memory standpoint\\n\\nCoupling:\\nHow much your programs depend on each other\\nLow is better\\n\\nCohesion: \\nHow well do things in a particular module relate to each other. \\nHigh is better\\n\\nSRP:\\nSingle responsibility principle: each class should just do one thing\\n\\nMVC: \\nA general way to structure programs.\\nModel, view, controller. \\nModel: Data and logic \\nView: Related to I/O. \\nController: helps decoupling presentation and logic. Is the primary communication mean between model and view. controlling/manipulating data\\n\\nException safety: \\nException throwing causes a stack unwinding, where the next highest catch is found. \\nWhile this is done, destructors are done for stack allocated objects. However, it is not done for heap allocated objects, which may lead to memory leaks. \\n\\nRAII:\\nResource allocation is initialization\\nGuarantees no memory leaks by making every object stack allocated. \\nConceptually, you wrap a pointer in a struct and remember to delete the pointer at the end. \\nSyntax: includes <memory> std::make_unique<class>(...);\\nIs essentially the same as a “new”\\nIn the impl, setting function = delete makes sure the method is disabled\\n\\nShared_ptr:\\nKeeps a counter of the ptr. Can raw pass into functions, but must be initialized in a special way. \\nIt must be initialized using the “make_shared<class>()” syntax, but additional pointers can be made by using the copy ctor on a shared_ptr<c> ctor \\n\\nException safety: \\nBasic guarantee, strong guarantee, nothrow guarantee\\nBasic: class invariants are maintained, no memory leaks. Program is left in a valid, but unspecified state. \\nStrong: If exception, then program is left in a state as if the function had never been invoked. \\nNothrow: function will always accomplish its task and never propagates an exception. \\n\\nGuaranteeing exception safety: \\nWe can guarantee exception by first testing if they work on a temporary object. If they don’t, then don’t execute anything. Ie. to preserve strong guarantee.\\nHowever, when we assign an item to a temporary object, we use the copy assignment operator. So in that case, we should instead try to swap pointers\\nWe can swap pointers to implementations. (pimpls)\\nIe. to execute a function, we first run them both on pointers to implementations. If they don’t throw an exception, then we std::swap the implementation and the temp at the end. \\n\\nException safety and vectors: \\nFollows raii, as when stack allocated vector goes out of scope the internal heap array is freed .\\nHowever, a vector of pointers will not get freed as pointers don’t have destructors. \\nMeanwhile, since unique pointers are stack allocated, an array of unique pointers would get freed. \\n\\nMove ctor and vectors:\\nWhenever a vector uses emplace_back, if the array capacity is reached, it must reallocate a new array. In this case, copying all the original elements into the new array would be a expensive. Note that this offers the strong guarantee because if exception the original array is unchanged b/c copying.\\nHowever, using move would mean that the strong guarantee is no longer offered. (as if throw while moving the original array is lost)\\nSo the objects move operator needs to be a nothrow guarantee. If the nothrow guarantee isn’t offered, it will just use the copy ctor. \\nIf you know a method will never propagate an exception, declare it “noexcept” in the header file. Ie MyClass(MyClass &&other) noexcept { ...}, \\nYou should try to make moves and swaps nothrow.\\n\\nCasting:\\nChanging one type to another. It isn’t recommended to use C casts in C++ (ie putting (int) in front of a char)\\n\\nCasting in C++:\\n4 types: static, reinterpret, const, dynamic\\nStatic: Compiler assumes you are correct. Could lead to undefined behaviour\\nReinterpret cast: generally leads to undefined behaviour\\nConst cast: allows you to get rid of const. Ie if a function field is supposed to be not const, and the variable is const, then const casting will allow you to use it regardless. \\nDynamic cast: Checks at runtime if conversion is possible. If it isn’t, then nullptr will be returned instead. \\nIf you dynamic cast to a reference and it fails, will return bad_cast\\nLikely cannot cast a unique pointer, as that would lead to a copy. Would have to use unique_ptr.get()\\n\\nVtables, Vptrs: \\nHow virtual methods work\\nClasses that contain a virtual method have 8 bytes of memory more than one that doesn’t, as it further stores a pointer to a vtable. \\nA subclass or superclass would have their own vtables. Also, calling to a vtable is slower\\n\\nDeadly diamond disambiguation:\\nd.obj.B::a = 100; dobj.C::a = 200; updates two different fields. \\nIf you want to share a variable, ask for “virtual inheritance”\\n\\nVirtual inheritance:\\nLike saying: I am ok with sharing my super class fields with other subclass members. \\nSyntax: class B: virtual public A {...}; \\nMeans that B shares the public field of A with other subclasses in same obj in case of deadly diamond. \\nQuestions: if a d object is created, the result of virtual inheritance means it will only have one A field. This A field is shared between the B, and C classes\\n\\nHow do template functions work?\\nThey just do. \\nIf they use any operators, they will use the operator< defined for type T. \\n\\n\\nTodo:\\n\\nIterators: \\nMake own linked list iterator\\n\\nTemplates:\\nMake own template\\n\\nExceptions: \\nMake an exception\\n\\nUnique_ptr / shared pointer: \\nCode syntax\\n\\nPolymorphic copy/move: \\nCreate big 5 for a subclass\\n\\nDecorator + Observer pattern:\\nAttempt to recreate the inclass example on your own\\n\\nCasting: syntax\\n\\n\\nSet notation:\\n\\nFactory pattern:\\n\\nMore polymorphic copy/move\\n\\nPimpl\\n\\nPractice UML'),\n",

CCCAA\\n\\nCompeting: \\nHigh assertiveness and low cooperation. Satisfying own self interests regardless on impact on other parties. \\nUseful for emergencies, important yet unpopular actions, for the organization’s welfare when you know you’re right, against people who take advantage of noncompetitive behaviour. \\nCollaborating:\\nHigh assertiveness, high cooperation. People clarify differences and accommodate various points of view. \\nUseful when you want to find an integrative solution that doesn’t require compromising, to learn, to merge insights from people with different perspectives, to gain commitment, to work through feelings that have interfered with a relationship.\\nAvoiding: \\nLow assertiveness and low cooperation. Withdrawing from or suppressing conflict. \\nUseful for trivial issues, to save effort when there’s no chance of satisfying concerns, to let people cool off, to first gather information, to move onto the next issue, when disruption outweighs resolution. \\nAccommodating: \\nLow assertiveness and high cooperation. Appeasing an opponent by placing the opponent’s interests above your own. \\nUseful when you know you’re wrong, to show reasonableness, maintaining cooperation, build social credits for later issues, minimize losses, maintain harmony and stability. \\nCompromising: \\nIntermediate level of assertiveness and cooperation. Each party seeks to give up something, resulting in a less-than-optimal outcome\\nUseful when: goals aren’t worth the effort or potential disruption of more assertive approaches, opponents with equal power are committed to mutually exclusive goals, to achieve a temporary settlement for complex issues, to arrive at a solution given a time constraint, backup when collaboration or competition isn’t successful.\\nConflict management styles: Dispositional and situational:\\nDispositional: Different individuals have a preferred style. Ie. Kevin is competing\\nSituational: When the native style is less effective, ie using a competing style against a police officer. Different situations have different effective styles\\nStress: \\nA psychological reaction that could make a person feel tense or nervous. \\n\\nStressors:\\nEnvironmental events or conditions that could induce stress. \\nChallenge stressors: ie workload, pressure to complete tasks, time urgency\\nHindrance stressor: stressors that keep you from reaching your goals (ie office politics, confusion over responsibilities)\\n\\nStrain and burnout: \\nStrain: A negative response to stress that leads to physiological and psychological responses\\nPhysiological: high blood pressure, susceptibility to disease\\nPsychological responses: anxiety, depression, exhaustion\\nBehavioural responses: poor performance, aggression, substance abuse, absenteeism\\nBurnout: syndrome with emotional exhauston, cynicism, and low self-efficacy\\n\\nOrganizational strategies to deal with stress: \\nJob redesign, family-friendly human resource policies, stress management programs, work-life balance, fitness, and wellness programs. \\nLeadership:\\n\\nEffective leadership:\\nEnhances productivity, innovation, satisfaction, and commitment of followers. \\nMore than just “influencing others to achieve goals” ← original description of leader\\n\\nLeader vs. Manager: \\nManagers: maintain the status quo\\nImplement, copy, maintain, control, think short-term, ask how and when, watch the bottom line, do things right. \\nLeaders: seek and implement change, provide vision, cause pain\\nCreate, originate, develop, inspire trust, think long-term, ask what and why, challenge the status quo. \\n\\nThree types of leadership:\\nTransactional, Laissez faire, transformational\\n\\nTransactional leadership:\\nLeadership characterized by a straightforward exchange between leader and followers\\nThree styles: Contingent reward, management by exception (active), management by Exception (passive)\\nContingent Reward: Contracts exchanges of rewards for effort, good performance, recognizes accomplishments\\nManagement by exception (active): actively watches and searches for mistakes, and corrects them.\\nManagement by exception (passive): intervenes only if standards aren’t met. \\n\\nLaissez-faire leaders:\\nLeaders who provide limited instructions, have limited contact with subordinates/team members, do not provide feedback/goals, “let people do their job”\\nNot very effect, is often frustrating for employees. \\n\\nTransformational Leadership: \\n4 Is: Intellectual stimulation, Individual consideration, Inspirational motivation, Idealized influence. \\nPositively related to job satisfaction, satisfaction with leader, trust in leader, motivation, organizational commitment, leader effectiveness, performance, extra effort\\n\\nTransactional vs. transformational:\\nTransformational, contingent reward are both linked to performance. \\nManagement by exception negatively (weakly) related to performance.\\nCan be both o.o (not mutually exclusive)\\n\\nCons of idealized influence (4th point of transformational):\\nReduces good suggestions by followers\\nReduces follower criticism\\nIllusions of invulnerability\\nChanges in risk perception.  (lots of groupthink symptoms)\\n\\nLeader-member exchange (LMX):\\nLeaders and followers develop unique relationships based on their social exchanges, and the quality of these relationships can influence employee outcomes. \\nFocuses on the quality of the relationship with the followers. When you give more attention to your followers, they tend to offer more back as well\\nBased on social exchange theory, where a relationship between people is determined by a cost-benefit analysis.\\nTo apply, followers should be competent, agreeable, conscientious, and extraverted. Leaders should be extraverted and agreeable, use contingent reward behaviour, and use transformational leadership\\nOutcomes: More organizational citizenship behaviours, higher job performance, higher commitment…\\n\\nTrait approach of leadership:\\nLeaders are determined by their traits. Ie, the intelligence, motivation, sociability, and etc. that they are born with. \\nLimitations: bidirectional ambiguity, does not tell us what the leader specifically does, does not take into account situation, alone are not sufficient for successful leadership\\nThey are often a better indicator of determining if they become a leader, rather than leader effectiveness. \\n\\nEmergent leadership (trait leadership):\\nEmergence positively related to: extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, intelligence, authoritarianism, leader experience, self-esteem. \\nTwo types of leaders: Task leader and social-emotional leader:\\nTask: focuses on accomplishing task\\nSocial-emotoinal: reduces tension, manages disagreements, settles arguments, maintains morale. \\n\\nSituational theories of leadership:\\nEffectiveness of leadership is contingent on the setting.\\nFiedler’s contingency theory\\nHouse’s path-goal theory. \\n\\nPath Goal Theory: \\nEffective leaders clear the path to the goal for their employees by removing pitfalls and roadblocks. \\nEffective leaders should accommodate subordinates’ situations to demonstrate leadership. \\nLeaders support by addressing environmental (task structure, authority system) and subordinate contingency factors (Locus of control, experience, perceived ability).\\nPath goal situations include directive (for ambiguous tasks), supportive (for stressed out people), participative (employee wants to participate), and achievement oriented (individuals like challenges and are highly motivated). \\nStrengths: generally supported, considers individuals and their situations. \\nWeaknesses: Better at predicting job satisfaction than performance. Relies on leaders being able to recognize the situations. \\n\\nCommunication:\\nProcess in which information is exchanged between sender and receiver. Could be informal or formal, upward, downward, lateral, horizontal, verbal, non-verbal. \\nBecause communication requires one party’s correct encoding and one party’s correct decoding, it can often lead to errors. \\n\\nSuggestions for effective communication\\nDon’t confuse person with problem, say what you feel (within reason), listen actively, provide timely and specific feedback, speak clearly slowly and simply. \\n\\nBarriers to effective communication\\nFiltering (ie sweetening your words), selective perception, defensiveness, language. \\n\\nEmployee voice\\nConstructive expression of disagreement or concern about work unit or organizational practices. Not just a complaint, but a constructive suggestion for improvement. \\nPositively related to job performance and creativity\\nVoice comes from a psychologically safe environment, and may lead to extraversion, conscientiousness, job satisfaction, organizational justice, etc. \\nLack of voice may lead to job stressors and strain, fear of retaliation. \\n\\nApologies to customers\\nSatisfaction related to interactional justice, distributive justice, intensity of apology, timing. \\n\\nSatisfaction with apologies are related to:\\nInteractional justice, distributive justice, empathy, intensity of apology, timing\\n\\nOrganizational culture:\\nThe shared beliefs, values, and assumptions that exist in an organization\\n\\nLevels of culture: \\nArtifacts, beliefs, values, assumptions. \\nIn order to change behaviour, you must change the underlying beliefs, values, and assumptions. These underlie the behaviours\\nArtifacts:\\nSymbols (visual representation), rituals (repeated behaviours by members), stories (narrative shared among the people, ie founder’s story), language (shared sayings ie a corny company slogan)\\n\\nImportance of culture:\\nA framework that guides the interpretation of experience and the choice of action\\n2 Primary functions: Integration and external adaptation\\n\\nWhere does culture come from?\\nInfluential leaders, ie founders or CEO, management, emergent leaders. \\n\\nSocialization: \\nHelps employees understand the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours that are necessary to function in the organization. \\nCan be done collectively or individually, formally or informally, sequentially or randomly. \\n\\nStrong vs. weak cultures:\\nStrong: beliefs, values, assumptions are intensely held, widely shared. Members have a high agreement on what is important. Lowers turnover, builds cohesiveness, loyalty, commitment. \\n\\nPros of strong cultures: \\nBetter communication: Can lead to better coordination because of shared values\\nConflict resolution: Can aid in conflict resolution because of shared values\\nFinancial success: Can lead to financial success because the culture may support the strategy of the organization\\n\\nCons of culture:\\nResistance to change: culture may impede change\\nCulture clash: merging cultures between two companies may be impossible\\nPathological cultures: cultures may be dysfunctional towards reaching organization’s goals ie. infighting, secrecy, unethical behaviours\\n\\nHow can organizational change occur?\\nGoals, technology, job design, structure, processes, culture, people\\n\\nCauses of Resistance to change:\\nPolitical or self interest, low individual tolerance for change, different assessments of situation, lack of trust\\n\\nOvercoming resistance:\\nAddress politics and self interest (ie by offering incentives)\\nEducate employees and managers (explain why it is happening, how change addresses the problem)\\nInvolve people in change process (be participative)\\nEmploy a transformational leadership style  (inspire a vision, trust, make note of individual concerns)\\n\\nHow to change culture:\\nHave top management set the tone.\\nCreate new stories, symbols, and rituals to replace current ones. \\nSelect, promote, and support employees who adopt these new values\\nRedesign socialization processes to align with new values. \\nChange reward system in favour of new values\\nReplace unwritten norms with formal rules and regulations that are enforced\\nShake up subcultures via transfers, job rotation, termination\\nGet peer consensus and create a climate of high trust. \\n\\nEthics:\\nA code of moral principles that influences behaviour/conduct/decision making by setting what is right or wrong.\\n\\n3 ethical principals:\\nUtilitarian: justified if deliver the greatest good to the greatest number of people\\nRights: Is right if abides by fundamental rights shared by human beings\\nJustice: justified if fair and impartial in its treatment of people\\n\\nUtilitarian: pros and cons\\nPros: Promotes efficiency and productivity\\nCons: Ignores rights of some individuals, harder to apply to values that aren’t easily quantified (ie health, life, employment)\\n\\nRights: \\nPros: Protects individuals from injuries concerning freedom and privacy\\nCons: Creates overly legalistic environment, hinders productivity and efficiency. \\n\\nJustice: pros and cons\\nPros: Protects interests of less powerful and underrepresented\\nCons: Encourages sense of entitlement, difficult to agree on definition of fairness, reduces risk taking, innovation, and productivity (because they want equal reward for equal effort) \\n\\nWhere can ethics be applied?\\nHonest communication, fair treatment, fair competition, responsibility to the organization, corporate social responsibility, respect for the law.\\n\\nCauses of unethical behaviours:\\n“Bad apple” (personality) - individuals with need for power, risk taking, moral identity\\n“Bad barrel” (situational) - role conflict, competition / scarce resources, pressures to conform, anonymity/lack of accountability, organizational/industry culture. \\n\\nStrategies to make better ethical decisions:\\nIdentify impact on people (ie have a guilty conscience, cost-benefit analysis) \\nObserve organizational systems (how do others do it with policies/procedures)\\nChoices (see your alternatives)\\n\\nSignalling theory: \\nWe assume that information is not the same across both parties, so we signal. \\nEthical initiatives signal the fitness of the organization. \\nActions signal the ethical nature of the leaders and the business.  \\n\\nSignalling theory and ethics:\\nLeadership can signal ethical behaviour through their actions and relationships. This happens by promoting ethical conduct through their decision making, communication, and reinforcement. \\nPositively related to subordinate ethical behaviour, job satisfaction, organizational comittment, organizational voice, trust in leader, job performance\\nNegatively related to: subordinate work stress, deviance, turnover. \\nTldr: signalling ethics comes with many benefits. \\n\\nCorporate social responsibility:\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do employees respond to CSR: \\nPositively related to organizational trust, organizational identification, work engagement, organizational commitment, job satisfaction and performance, citizenship behaviours\\nNegatively related to: turnover intentions, organizational deviance\\nTends to be a positive relationship between financial performance and socially responsible behaviour\\n\\nSources of ethical values: \\nPersonal ethics, organizational culture and systems, external stakeholders. \\n\\nFormal/structural sources of ethics:\\nStructure ie assigning ethics officer\\nDisclosure mechanisms ie rewarding ethical acts\\nCode of ethics: must be followed\\nTraining programs\\n\\nPower:\\nCapacity that A can influence B to act in their wishes. \\nInvolves potential and dependency\\n\\nPower vs. authority: \\nPower is not necessarily reflected on an organizational chart\\nAuthority can be prescribed by a formal hierarchy.\\n\\n5 bases of power:\\nLegitimate power (from structure), reward power (from valence), coercive power (from punishment or threat), referent power (from being liked), expert power (from expertise or information). \\n\\n\\n\\nWon’t cover stress as much\\nWhat is conflict?\\nThree diff styles?\\nHow to respond to conflict?

In this section, we will be analyzing a manager’s successful implementation of a Devil’s Advocate “and the obstacles that needed to be overcome”.\\n\\nFinding and implementing a Devil’s Advocate is a challenging yet rewarding task.\\nIn Hidden Figures, Katherine is designated the role of a Devil’s Advocate when her sole responsibilities are to double check calculations and “think beyond the numbers”. Eventually, we see how her alternative perspectives lead to the success of the Task Force.\\n\\nFrom a managerial perspective, Katherine’s selection as a Devil’s Advocate was correct. Her status as a newcomer and outsider suggests she is initially unaffected by the pressures of groupthink. She is sensitive to the illusions of invulnerability and stereotypes towards outsiders that the task force possesses.\\n\\nTo real-life managers, this shows how challenging reducing groupthink may be. As even managers themselves are members of the group, they may be unaware of their own groupthink. Thus, it is critical to implement the correct Devil’s Advocate.\\n\\nThe failure to acknowledge Devil’s Advocates have had significant ramifications, even in modern businesses.

Everything else exists to help you in making your best work, such as entertainment, clubs, and whatever extra things you can add to that. \\n\\nBut man, I think that way of life is so hard to maintain. I keep wanting to sleep more and more. It’s not that I have little time for myself, but that I’d rather spend the time I have on activities that aren’t work.

It’s a pain to see this discrepancy, and instead feel tired and wanting just a good night’s sleep. \\n\\nIt’s unfair how others can operate on half the amount of sleep I require, and perform just as well. I wish I could be built differently like that. I wish I could possess a motivation machine, and also a personality changer. I think it might be the case that my ideal self is not my current self. \\n\\nI’d imagine the best sleep would leave one energized and ready to start their day, like the sleep I used to have.

I’m endlessly grateful for my parents, and I know it’s morally correct to give back. But how can I morally express that I’m just too lazy to do anything. It’s like how the the controls of my mind are in conflict with each other. There are many things I believe I want to do, yet so little things I actually do.

As I continue typing this, I can feel myself getting more and more energized. I feel like I’ve come to a realization, and that it may be an infinite energy exploit. I see the goal I want, and I think it may be possible for me to act on it. It’s alright to be jealous of others, because it isn’t in my own control, as much as what I do with my own life. Instead, I should start controlling the things I can control myself, including when I work, how I deal with my leisure time, and, most importantly, the sleep that I get. \\n\\nI should go work now, it’s about time.

Max 1h10 per lesson, 1hr + 10 min break per chapter\\n\\n\\nChapters to study:\\nGroup\\nMotivation 1, 2\\nDecision making\\nNegotiation\\n\\nGroup (definition):\\nTwo or more people interacting interdependently to achieve a common goal.\\n\\nSituations to use groups:\\nProblem is uncertain or complex (hard to identify expertise)\\nProblem require intergroup cooperation (ie someone needs to complete their work before you can start yours)\\nProblem requires general commitment and acknowledgement\\n\\nFactors to consider when using groups\\nCan the job be done better with more than one person?\\nDoes the job require creativity, innovation, complex decision making, wide variety of skillsets? (all these ex. Favor using groups.)\\nDoes the work lead to common goals or leave people with their individual ones?\\nAre members of the group interdependent? (ie. do they even need each other) \\n\\nDoes group size improve performance?\\nDepends on the task.\\nAdditive: yes\\nDisjunctive: yes, but up to the best performer\\nConjunctive: not always, esp. When it depends on worst performer. \\n\\n3 types of tasks\\nAdditive: sum total of group size matter (ie war)\\nDisjunctive: best contributor matters (ie working on same qs together)\\nConjunctive: worst contributor matters (ie relay race)\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between group size and satisfaction?\\nNegative\\nSocial inhibition about participating in larger groups\\nIndividual contributions are less obvious, can lead to weaker identification. \\n\\nAdv. and disadv. of group diversity:\\nPros: multiple perspectives, more openness, (make some up yourself)\\nCons: Harder to reach agreement, confusion, miscommunication, etc.\\n\\nSurface/deep group diversity and ideal level of diversity:\\nSurface: ie age, gender, or race\\nDeep: Differences in attitudes, problem solving\\nRule of thumb: include enough to make use of different perspectives but not too much that it hinders performance and communication\\n\\nSocial loafing: \\nTendency to slack off in group work, when they would otherwise work harder individually\\nInclude free riders\\nSubject to free rider effect: people lower their efforts because they think others are free riding (to restore equity) \\nSubject to sucker effect: where people work less hard in fear of people thinking negatively of them for working too hard. \\n\\nPreventing social loafing:\\nMake indv. Performance more visible\\nMake sure work is interesting\\nMake worker feel indispensable\\nInclude performance feedback. \\nReward group performance \\n\\nLesson 8: Motivation\\n\\nMotivation:\\nThe extent to which persistent effort is applied towards a goal\\nFactors include effor (quantity), persistence (continuous effort, quantity)), direction (quality, means), and goals\\n\\nImportance of motivation\\nKey driving factor for task performance\\nOther mediating factors (for task performance include personality, general cognitive ability, task understanding, emotional intelligence, chance)\\n\\nIntrinsic motivation:\\nIntrinsic: wanting to do a task for its own sake. Is usually self applied, and is effective over time. (strong stable impact) \\nCons: hard to get perfect alignment with job, personal interests could skew job, high attachment will lead to more sensitivity to criticism\\n\\nExtrinsic:\\nExtrinsic: wanting to do a task for an external reward. Usually applied by others, and is effective only temporarily.\\nCons: works better for simple, but not challenging/creative jobs\\n\\nNeed theories:\\nAre concerned with WHAT motivates workers. Includes psychological and physiological needs. \\nMaslows hierarchy of needs: Needs list where lowest unsatisfied need has the greatest motivating potential. In order of importance (physiological, safety, belongingness, self-esteem, self-actualization) \\nAlderfer’s ERG theory: Compressed Maslows. Existence, relatedness, growth. \\nMclellands: needs reflect personality characteristics acquired from social interaction. People could have a need for achievement, affiliation, power.\\nSelf determination\\n\\nSelf determination theory:\\nPeople are motivated by self-determination, or autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Exists on a continuum from autonomous to controlled.\\nAutonomous: self-motivated from intrinsic factors\\nControlled: motivated by desired consequence or extrinsic reward. \\nSelf motivation is caused by 3 needs: autonomy (live for self), competence (experience), and relatedness (connections). \\n\\nProcess theories:\\nHOW motivation works. \\nGoal setting theory: Goals are motivational when specific and challenging\\nExpectancy theory, motivation is determined by outcomes that people expect to occur from their actions. \\nEquity theory: People work hard for their outcomes  in proportion to how hard others are working for their outcomes. \\nOrganizational justice theory: \\n\\nExpectancy theory:\\nPeople are motivated by their expected outcome.\\nMotivation is influenced by 3 aspects: expectancy, instrumentality, valence\\nExpectancy: relationship between performance and outcome quality. \\nInstrumentality: relationship between outcome quality and outcome reward.\\nValence: relationship between outcome reward and satisfaction. \\n\\nHow can managers use expectancy theory?\\nBoost expectancies, instrumentality, or valence\\nExpectancies: better training/feedback => higher quality => higher expectancies\\nInstrumentality: fair performance assessments and rewarding system\\nValence: be aware that rewards may be different for different people. \\n\\nHow do goals affect motivation (+ aspects of effective goals)?\\nGoals must be specific, challenging, measurable. \\nGoals => behaviour => feedback => satisfaction discrepancy => refocusing goal. (motivation through discrepancy production) \\n\\nHow does goal setting benefit?\\nDirects attention, mobilizes effort, encourages persistence, leads to strategy development. \\n\\nLesson 9: more on motivation\\n\\nRole of money in motivation:\\nMost commonly used reward in organizations\\nHelps some needs get met\\n\\nWage incentive plans + cons:\\nSystems that link pay to performance on production jobs\\nCons: lowered quality, differential opportunity (ie some production facilities are better equipped for better performance), reduced cooperation, incompatible job design\\nCons: restriction of productivity: an artificial limitation of work output that can occur under wage incentive plans\\n\\nMerit pay plans + cons:\\nSystems that link pay to performance on white collar jobs. \\nCons: low discrimination (managers unwilling to identify + recognize additional effort), small increases, pay secrecy\\n\\nHow pay can help teamwork:\\nProfit sharing, employee stock ownership, gainsharing, skill-based pay\\n\\nWhy is money not every employee’s top priority + relation between pay level and satisfaction:\\nPeople value relationships in the workplace (relatedness), opportunities for development (growth / competence) \\nVery weak positive relationship between money and job satisfaction\\nWeak positive relationship between money and pay satisfaction\\n\\nWhat are reward follies? Why do they happen?\\nWhen organizations “reward A while hoping for B”\\nIe. encourage teamwork but only reward the best working members\\nReasons: Stuck in old patterns of reward and recognition, short-term oriented, don’t look at big picture, make assumptions\\n\\nCognitive evaluation theory:\\nAllocating extrinsic rewards for behaviour that was previously intrinsically rewarded tends to decrease the overall level of motivation\\nOccurs because people lose control over their behaviour, and their internal explanation changes to an external explanation. \\nA part of self determination theory (recap: people are motivated by autonomy, competency, relatedness)\\n\\nCharacteristics of effective rewards:\\nRecognize individual differences\\nLink rewards to performance\\nFormal rewards are not everything (ie less focus on rewards, more focus on creating a good environment)\\n\\nJob characteristics theory:\\nJob design is an intrinsic motivator. \\nA well designed job will lead to higher internal work motivation, better performance, higher satisfaction, and lower absenteeism and turnover. \\nThere are core characteristics of a job that have a strong potential to affect motivation: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, feedback from job (FSTAT, fun statistics amirite )\\n\\nMotivating potential score (MPS): \\nMPS = autonomy * job feedback * (skill variety + task identity + task significance) / 3\\nFrom the equation, autonomy and feedback are very important. The other 3 are less significant\\n\\nLesson 10/11:\\nDecision making\\nThe process of developing a commitment to some course of action\\nProcess: weigh information, compare alternatives, evaluate decisions\\nWe should follow a systematic way of decision making\\n\\nPerfect vs bounded rationality:\\nPerfect: decision strategy that is completely informed, perfectly logical, and oriented towards economic gain\\nBounded rationality: A decision strategy that relies on limited information and that reflects time constraints and political considerations\\n\\nPerfect rational decision making procedure\\nIdentify problem, search for relevant information, develop alternative solutions to the problem, explore alternative solutions, choose best solution, implement chosen solution, monitor and evaluate chosen solution\\n\\nAssumptions of rational model;\\nProblem is clear and unambiguous, we know all the options, preferences are constant, no time or cost constraints, maximum payoff\\nRational model relies on rational thinking\\n\\nBounded rationality:\\nManagers can be restricted by: capacity to acquire and process information, time constraints, political considerations, self-interest\\n\\nHow are decisions actually made (bounded):\\nLots of automatic thinking\\nFull of bias and heuristics\\nWe are ok with a “good enough” solution, since we are limited by our information and processes. \\nWe use intuition\\n\\nProblem framing:\\nThe manner in which objectively equivalent alternatives are presented\\nGain frame: Positively framed information. It encourages conservative decisions as we would prefer a sure thing over a chance at gaining more\\nLoss frame: Negatively framed information. It encourages risk, as we would take a chance at losing rather than accepting a sure loss. \\n\\nGroupthink (pros):\\nGroups are more vigilant than individuals at scanning the environment\\nGroups can generate more ideas than individuals can\\nGroups can evaluate ideas better than individuals can\\nDiffusion of responsibility: The ability of group members to share the burden of the negative consequences of a poor decision. \\n\\nGroupthink symptoms:\\nIllusion of invulnerability, rationalization, illusion of morality, stereotypes of outsiders, pressure to conform, self-censorship (members decide not to voice contrary opinions), illusion of unanimity, mindguards (members protect group from information that goes against decisions)\\n\\nDevil’s advocate:\\nCan be used to challenge groupthink \\nA person appointed to identify and challenge the weaknesses of a proposed plan or strategy\\nIntroduces controversy, brings in extra information, illuminates full pros and cons of decision\\n\\nHow groups can perceive risk:\\nGroup discussion polarizes or exaggerates the initial positions of group members through risk shifts or conservative shifts\\nRisk shift: groups may make riskier decisions than the average risk initially planned by individual members\\nConservative shift: tendency for groups to make less risky decisions than average for individual members\\n\\nEscalation of commitment + reasons:\\nThe tendency to invest additional resources in an apparently failing course of action\\nSunk costs are permanent losses that have occurred from the result of a decision. \\nBecause these resources have already been lost, they should not factor in future decisions.\\nReasons: People want to recoup the sunk cost to reduce dissonance, people have overconfidence that the additional investment will succeed, social norms favour consistent behaviour (ie continuing down a failing road)\\n\\nHow to “de-escalate” commitment:\\nActively seek disconfirming information, reframe losses as gains to prevent risk seeking behaviour (problem framing), not punish decision makers for inconsistency, hand off decision making to others, not consider expended resources\\n\\nWhen can structure help with decision making? (rational):\\nHistory of conflict, no history of past interaction, lots of people, participants of unequal status, scarce on time, heterogenous group, high need to get acceptance and commitment. \\n\\nLesson 12: \\nNegotiation\\nA decision-making process among interdependent parties who do not share identical preferences\\nDistributive bargaining\\nwin-lose negotiation that seeks to divide up a fixed amount of resources\\nFixed amount of resources, gain is others’ expense,  diametrically opposed interests, short term relationships\\n\\nIntegrative bargaining: \\nwin-win negotiation that assumes mutual problem-solving can enlarge the assets to be divided. \\nVariable amount of resources, maximizes joint outcomes, convergent or congruent interests, long-term relationships. \\n\\nHow to negotiate:\\nAssess personal goals, consider others’ goals, develop strategy\\nIdentify target and resistance points. Target: what one would like to achieve. Resistance: lowest outcome acceptable\\nIdentify BATNA: Best alternative to negotiated agreement\\nBargaining zone:\\nA zone where the resistance points of either party overlap.\\nAlso known as the settlement range. \\nIf one doesn’t exist, the parties will not come to an agreement\\n\\nTactics in distributive negotiation\\nThreats and promises\\nFirm posturing\\nSmall concessions offered strategically\\nVerbal persuasion\\n\\nTactics in integrative bargaining:\\nExchange large amounts of information\\nReframing differences as opportunities\\nCutting costs of agreement\\nIncreasing resources\\nIntroducing superordinate goals. \\n\\nBATNA: \\nBest alternative to negotiated agreement\\nYou should not be accepting less than your BATNA\\nFind out as much as you can about your opponent’s BATNA\\n\\nHow does planning help in negotiation?\\nSet target and resistance points\\nPlanning will tell you when to walk away and when an agreement is acceptable\\n\\nCommon mistakes in negotiation\\nIrrational escalation in commitment: refusing to abandon a previously chosen action when a more rational once exists\\nBelief in the mythical fixed pie: assuming that your interests conflict with the other party, leads to win-lose thinking. \\nAnchoring and adjustment: An anchor could be too large or too little. Setting the right anchor will allow others to take you seriously while giving you a position to argue from. \\nSplitting the difference is not always the best solution, and can be quite costly sometimes. Look for solutions that allow for both parties to win. \\n\\nHow to improve your bargaining position:\\nBegin positively\\nAddress problems, not personalities\\nPay little attention to initial offers\\nEmphasize win-win solutions\\nCreate an open and trusting climate'),\n",

An effective cover letter requires inserting keywords from the job description and the company page, yet a time effective cover letter requires under 5 minutes for its creation. The goal of this project is to achieve this feat by allowing users to generate genuine-sounding, organic cover letters with minimal effort. \\nProject Overview\\n\\nCover Master speeds up the cover letter creation process using intelligently suggested words. These suggested words would occupy placeholders in the user’s cover letter template. By being able to view a list of relevant keywords and qualities to the job description, the user may either choose from a suggested word or customize their own to enter into their cover letter. This allows users to generate organic cover letters that are human enough to pass captcha tests, yet robotic enough given the speed they are created. Future plans for the project would involve scaling to distinguish between users and storing different templates. \\nTechnical Details\\n\\nThe main technical challenges to this project would be the UI/UX, the word selection, and if time permits, the scaling for multiple users. Some skills that will likely be useful are in Natural language AI, React, some form of web scraping, and database management. I believe a mentor can help the most in the organization of the project. Using individual frameworks/technologies may not be much of a challenge, but putting them together into a finished product is something whose success will depend more on experience. A mentor will benefit this project by guiding its technical aspect in the right direction.'),\n",

Has to do with the validity of the study design\\nExternal Validity: Extent to which the results of a study generalize to other samples and settings. External validity is greater when the results of a study are based on a larger sample size\\nCorrelation does not prove causation but it indicates an association\\nResearch Techniques/Designs\\nCase studies (Often qualitative rather than quantitative)\\nObservational (direct observation, participant observation)\\nCorrelational (Surveys, interviews, existing data, etc)\\nExperimental (Quasi experiments, true experiments)\\n\\n\\nLesson 3 Definitions:\\nApproaches to personality research\\nAll three study personality. \\nDispositional: We assume that personality is a stable characteristic, and that people are predisposed to behave in certain ways. \\nSituational: Personality has a stronger impact on weak (roles loosely defined) situations, and weaker impact on stronger scenarios\\nInteractionalist: Most widely used, supported. Observes personality while considering the situation\\nBig 5 personalities (CANOE / OCEAN) + implication on job performance\\nConscientiousness: organization, reliability. Relatively strong correlation with job performance for most jobs\\nAgreeableness: getting along with others, courtesy, trust, tolerance. Good relationship with job performance in service jobs\\nNeuroticism (emotional instability): inability to handle stress, insecurities, emotional instability. A minimum is necessary for job performance.\\nOpenness to experience: creativity, originality, open-mindedness. Positively related to training proficiency\\nExtraversion/Introversion: Degree of comfort in relationships, sociability. Positively related with job performance when job requires social interaction\\nLocus of control:\\nOrigins of the factors that motivate you. Could be internal or external (environment)\\nImplication of employees’ personalities\\nNote: Consider alignment between person and job + organization\\nPerson-job fit: Better person-job fit leads to higher satisfaction, decreased turnover. \\nPerson-organization fit: People leave organizations that don’t align with their personality\\n\\nLesson 4 Definitions:\\nReasons for learning:\\nDecrease bad behaviour, increase desired behaviour\\nLaw of effect:\\nPeople repeat behaviours that bring them satisfaction and pleasure, and stop those that bring them dissatisfaction and pain\\nOperant learning theory:\\nSubject learns by operating on their environment. Ie. mouse learning they can get food by tugging lever\\n4 methods of learning (training methods) from operant learning theory:\\nPositive reinforcement\\nNegative reinforcement\\nPunishment\\nExtinction\\nPositive reinforcement:\\nIncrease of a desired behaviour by adding a stimulus\\nIe. rewards added -> better performance\\nNegative reinforcement\\nIncrease of a desired behaviour by removing a stimulus\\nIe. removing habitual nagging when employee does well -> employee continues doing well\\nPunishment\\nDecrease of a desired behaviour by doing something undesirable\\nIe slapping an employee -> won’t steal food anymore\\nExtinction\\nDecrease of a desired behaviour by removing something\\nIe removing cell phones in the workplace -> higher performance\\nEffects of continuous vs. partial reinforcement\\nContinuous: leads to fast acquisition\\nPartial: leads to persistence\\nEffects of timing of reinforcement on learning\\nShort: fast acquisition\\nLong: persistence\\nAspects of effective rewards:\\nreinforces to the indv. \\nreinforces the right behaviour\\nRewards better performers better\\nNew behaviours: continuous reinforcement, established behaviours: partial. \\nProblems with punishment:\\nOnly indicates bad behaviour, does not indicate an alternative behaviour\\nTemporary fix, people find alternatives\\nTriggers negative emotions\\nEffective punishments:\\nImmediate, consistent, effective (ie a real punishment)\\nProvide alternative\\nUse when behaviour must be stopped immediately. \\n\\nLesson 5 Definitions:\\nPerception: \\nthe way individuals organize their thoughts to form judgements. \\nDrives all our behaviour, but can be flawed/biased\\nFactors that influence perception\\nContext (time, setting…), target (size, background…), perceiver\\nSocial identity theory: \\nPeople’s perceptions of themselves are based off their personal characteristics and membership in social categories. A social and personal identity\\nUseful for understanding stereotyping/discrimination because people tend to perceive themselves/their own categories in more favourable ways\\nCommon perceptual biases:\\nSelective perceptions (own POV), primacy effects, recency effects, Halo/Horn effect (ie [entire character] must be good b/c their [trait] is good, projection (own feelings -> others)\\nFast vs. slow thinking + difference\\nFast: unconscious thought. Allows us to quickly interpret scenarios. Causes errors due to implicit biases and shortcuts\\nSlow: conscious thought. \\nDifference: Slow thinking less shortcuts, less biases. \\nStereotyping:\\nGeneralizing about others based on their group membership\\nConsequences: unfairness, negative treatment, decreased organizational performance\\nAttribution theory:\\nHow the social perceiver determines whether someone’s action is internally or externally motivated (ie is it dispositional or situational)\\nJudged on 3 bases of the other person: Distinctiveness (same in diff. situations?), consensus (act the same as others?), consistency (same over time?)\\nBiases in attribution theory:\\nFundamental attribution: people underestimate external factors and overestimate internal factors  when making judgements on others\\nActor-observer effect: actors and observers view the causes of the actor’s behaviour differently\\nSelf serving bias: Own successes are attributed on internal factors, failure on external factors. \\nConfirmation bias: seek only confirmatory info, not disconfirming info. \\n\\nLesson 6 Definitions: \\n\\n4 dimensions of cultures\\nPower distance (ie social hierarchy)\\nUncertainty avoidance (risk aversion)\\nFemininity vs masculinity (equals vs sigma male)\\nIndividualism vs collectivism (independence vs. independence)\\n\\nAttitudes:\\nA fairly stable tendency to respond consistently to some specific target. Ie workplace attitude\\nJob satisfaction\\nCollection of attitudes workers have about their job. \\nThere are many facets that contribute to job satisfaction ie. work, pay, bosses\\nJob satisfaction is an attitude\\n30% is influenced by genes, 70% by behaviour\\n\\nDimensions of fairness\\nDistributive (based on outcome)\\nProcedural (based on how you bring the outcome) \\nInteractional (based on interpersonal ie respect and informational ie detailed explanation)\\n\\nEquity theory: \\nPeople compare their job inputs and outcomes with those of others, and respond to eliminate any inequities\\nEquity: Outcomes / inputs = referent’s outcomes / inputs\\nPeople could change inputs, outcomes, adjust self/others’ perceptions\\n\\nHow can behaviour affect attitude (2 theories):\\nSelf perception theory: people make inferences about their attitudes based on perceptions of their behaviour. Ie someone realizes they like rice because they reach towards the rice\\nCognitive dissonance: when behaviour and attitudes are inconsistent, it could lead to anxiety and a change in attitude.\\n\\nOrganizational commitment (OC) and organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB):\\nOC: Attitude based on connection between employee and organization\\nOCB: Voluntary, informal behaviour that contributes to organiztional effectiveness. \\nOther commitments (WRT organizations): affective, continuance, normative.'),\n",

After, we realized that Staples Studios offices have great potential to help these startups succeed given that most of there clientele are like-minded businesspeople. However, people who rent a Staples Studio office typically focus on their own work rather than collaborate with others.\\n\\n## What it does\\n\\nOur project incorporates some of Staple's previous services, including: Staples Studios, B2B analytical content, and various activities aimed to help startups grow (e.g. lessons on how to set up an e-commerce site).\\n\\nSimilar to crowdfunding, this project is a platform where startups can feature their products in any Staples Studio office, which invites discussion around the startups. Businesspeople who frequent Staples Studio offices have the opportunity to find inspiration from the new ideas in front of them, as well as spot enticing business partnerships without too much effort. Staples Studio clientele can also leave reviews and comments on the exhibits before them, which, after being aggregated and analyzed by our platform, will help startups drive in the right direction.\\n\\nThe goal of our project is to make Staples Studios a perfect incubator for inspiration, genius ideas, and passionate startups. Since startups benefit from having more engagement around their products, and Staples benefits by inviting clients to rent office space, this solution provides a win-win by bringing the right people together.\\n\\n\\n\\n## How we built it\\nThis project consists of a frontend, a backend, and a database. The frontend made with React, and the backend is made with Express. The database is made with MongoDB using Mongoose. \\n\\n## Challenges we ran into\\nWe ran into conflicting dependencies that caused it to properly compile on one machine, but fail to build on another. We figured out that separating the backend and frontend into different repositories resolved the issue by isolating the conflicting dependencies. \\n\\nWe also had trouble submitting to Devpost -- we wrote this segment three times, after forgetting to save once and losing internet on the second. This time, the third time, we will save this document into a Google Doc. \\n\\n## Accomplishments that we're proud of\\nWe are proud of our database, which was built on MongoDB using Mongoose. Since it was our first time with MongoDB Atlas, we were happy we could correctly apply the database. We are also proud of our backend, as we found using Postman to be very helpful in organizing our project. It is a shame only 3 of our total members could enjoy the endpoints we created, due to free trial restrictions. \\n\\n## What we learned\\nWe learned that backend development is so much more different than frontend. For future hackathons, we are looking into swapping our roles for us all to experience everything,\\n\\n## What's next for Staple Studio Startups\\nAuthentication of clientele vs startups. We need a way to verify that startups using our product are genuine.\"),\n",

I think, however, that I can describe what it feels like. I’m currently listening to “Mirror Tune”, which is a new Zutomayo song that was released only a few weeks ago. It was a pretty catchy song, and though it took me some time to get used to, I eventually got used to the song and began liking it. I also think the animations are pretty. Anyhow, “Mirror Tune” was one of the songs that I listened to greatly as I studied for exams. At the time, everything felt right. I was being productive, I was coping effectively with my music, and I was anticipating good results on all my exams. To me, there seemed to be balance with whatever I did with my life. Effort was rewarded with results, and results were rewarded with music, which helped me push out more effort. I don’t know if this cycle is toxic/ineffective or not, but at the minimum, it gave me a sense of purpose. \\n\\nI think I admire those in webcomics with just a hollow look in their eyes. It makes them seem as if they’ve gone through a lot, and that future unexpected struggles are just something else that’s also expected. Whether they’re abuse victims or trauma survivors, there’s something about the dead look in their drawn eyes that makes them seem more real, more alive than any other characters.\\n\\nAs cool as they are, though, I think my admiration for them is a tad bit dangerous. It rewards me for feeling apathetic and blankly staring at whatever’s ahead of me. It gives me a mental excuse whenever I feel like I’m done tolerating any one of my friends or family members. I suppose, in the end, all I feel is more empty afterwards. Empty from the connections I’m not taking initiative to tolerate or maintain, empty from the neglect of the invisible sense of obligation to care for these relationships, and empty for struggling to see what’s so special about this bright world in front of me. \\n\\nI’m definitely privileged. I think I’ve been given every possible resource to succeed, and there really is no aspect of my given life that’s below average. I’ve got two loving parents, enough money so that my present has no problems, and enough brainpower that my future will have no problems either. I also live in a time of peace and freedom where I may do whatever I want, and reach out to whoever I need. So, when given all these resources and privileges, I simply can’t figure out why I sometimes feel wronged, cheated, and unsatisfied with the life around me. It’s like I’m interacting with the world through a thin film of plastic, somewhat detached but still completely immersed within.'),\n",

This happens when you run out of memory\\nDangling pointer: A pointer that points to freed memory. Ie, if you try accessing the pointer, it doesn’t know what to return. It’s good practice to assign null right after freeing something. \\n\\nfree(null) is ignored. \\n\\nMemory leak: When allocated memory is not eventually freed. \\nGarbage collector:  detects when memory is no longer in use and automatically frees memory and returns it to the heap. \\nCould be slow and affects performance. C does not have a garbage collector. \\n\\nMerge sort strategy: \\nSplit an unsorted list in half\\nSort the left side, sort the right side\\nCreate a final list with all sorted elements by alternating between either list. \\nEfficiency: nlogn\\n\\nAllocating and deallocating memory affects the state of the heap. The caller may be responsible for freeing the memory. (note in effects section)\\n\\nAn effect could also be it frees allocated memory. \\n\\nStrdup: mallocs a new string, copies over the contents of the old string, returns the new string. \\n\\nRealloc: used when resizing an array. O(n), needs to copy\\nSteps: creating a new array, copying over the items from the old to the new array, freeing the old array\\n\\n\\nDoubling strategy: When the array is full, we double the length of the existing array using realloc. Needs to have maxlen and len variables. \\n\\nTo properly free an array of strings, each string must be freed in addition to the array itself\\n\\nADTs provide security and flexibility. \\n\\\\\\nAmortized analysis: Another way for average. We say that the amortized running time of stack_push is O(1) because it’s the average running time. An O(n) operation, the realloc to a newly sized array, doesn’t not occur for every element. \\n\\nChapter 11: Linked lists\\n\\nLinked list: each node contains an item and a link to the next node in the list. \\nIn C, the link in the last node is a NULL pointer\\n\\nLinked list nodes are not arranged sequentially in memory. There’s no fast and convenient way to jump to the i-th element. The list must be traversed from the front. Traversing a linked list is O(n);\\n\\nThe memory for each node is allocated dynamically. \\n\\nRecursive data structures: Have a pointer to its own structure type. Ie. a pointer to a malloced part of memory of the same structure. \\n\\nCould add allocates memory to the front, but is redundant because all linked lists do so. \\nAdding to the front: \\nCreate a new node\\nSet the new nodes next element as the current “front” element\\nSet the new node as the “front” element. \\n\\nTraversing a linked list: We typically use a pointer to keep track of the current node. \\n\\nDestroying a list: use two pointers to make sure they’re freed in a safe way. \\nCurnode, nextnode to determine the current node to be freed, the next node to be freed. \\nNextnode must be established because we can’t access the value of a freed variable. \\n\\nDuplicating a list:\\nRecursive: Create a new list. Recursively create new nodes using the old node’s and new nodes “next” \\nIterative: Create a new list, iterate through all elements of the old list and set them as elements of the new list. \\n\\nInserting into the middle of a list:\\nIterate through the list until you find the right position. Set the previous pointer to point at the new node, set the new node to point at the previous’s next. \\n\\nRemoving nodes: similar to inserting\\n\\nData integrity: When the same information is stored in more than one way. An example of security: protecting the client from themselves. \\nIe. the client may mess up when establishing the length of the queue adt\\n\\nQueue ADT: \\nFirst in first out (add back, remove front combination)\\nImplemented using linked lists\\nHas an additional pointer to the back of the list. \\n\\nAdd back: set the last element’s “next” to be a new node, if there is one. \\n\\nRemove front: set the first element to be the next element.\\n\\nInserting into a BST: recursively do it. If its greater than the item, place it in the right subtree. Else, put it in the left. \\n\\nBalanced trees have height of log n\\n\\nFreeing a tree: free the right tree, the left tree, the value, then the original node. \\n\\nRemoving a node from a BST: \\nLocate the node\\nIf it’s a leaf, then cool, easy\\nIf not, then find the next largest node to replace it. You can find it by recursing for the smallest element in the target’s right subtree. That node can essentially replace the first node, which you will then do.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12: Abstract data types:\\n\\nEvery data structure is a combination of the following core data structures\\nPrimitives (ie int)\\nStructures (ie struct)\\nArrays, linked lists, trees, graphs\\n\\nDesign considerations:\\nHow frequently you’ll have to add/remove items\\nHow frequently you will search for items\\nDo you have to access an item at a specific position?\\nDo you need  to preserve the original sequence\\nCan you have duplicate items?\\n\\nSequenced data: order matters. Unsequenced: order is not important\\n\\nIe. BSTs are impractical for sequenced data\\n\\nUse arrays when you frequently access elements at specific positions\\n\\nA linked list is a good choice for sequenced data if you frequently add or remove from the start\\n\\nA self balancing BST is good for unsequenced data if you frequently search for add and remove items\\n\\nA sorted array is a good choice if you rarely add/remove, but frequently search for elements and select the data in sorted order. \\n\\nTypical collection ADTs: \\nStack: linked lists or dynamic arrays\\nQueue: linked lists\\nSequence: (linked lists or dynamic arrays) \\nDictionary (BSTs);\\n\\nVoid pointers:\\nVoid pointers can store the address (point at) any type of data, very generic\\nVoid pointers cannot point at functions\\n\\nWhen assigning from void pointers, wel lost type safety and could have a pointer pointing to the wrong type. \\n\\nWhen making a structure with void pointers, stack_destroy for ex would require the user to free all existing data first. (client is responsible for freeing all the items)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'Injustice speech script', 'date': '2022-03-23T15:30:00.854Z'}, page_content='Throughout my first year courses, I began considering the single question that keeps 90% of double degrees up at night: Should I drop this program? In pondering this question, I evaluated various testimonies, reread the program description, and stared into the abyss of BU121, everyone’s favourite course. Though my search concluded with a convincing “no”, it was here where I noticed the injustice of the current education system – the injustice that has timelessly plagued university students. The injustice that stems from the forceful ultimatums of programs and the certain nature of compulsory “electives”. \\n\\nThe first injustice concerns the ultimatum imposed on students upon entering university: to narrow the scope of our education. As students, we are heavily encouraged to remain in our program/faculty, as shown by the restrictions placed on our educational options. For example, to transfer from one engineering course into another, you must undergo a competitive and extensive screening procedure. If you succeed, you must then restart as a first year. Alternatively, to transfer across faculties, you must exceed admission requirements and be in good academic standing. Though this makes sense on paper, it fails to consider students who wish to transfer and struggle academically solely because of incompatibility with their program. This injustice is shown through survey responses by the Double Degree Club, where a majority of respondents noted they haven’t yet dropped because they’re “too far in”. Though some may blame the individual student for their lack of foresight, it’s important to consider the people we were before university. It’s unjust that as mere high schoolers, we’re encouraged to funnel our future education without a security net to save us from living a hollow life. \\n\\nThe second injustice relates to the selection of compulsory “elective” courses, and can be separated into student and academic injustices. \\n\\nFrom the student’s perspective, compulsory ‘electives’ oppose both students’ learning and employment objectives. This is shown in the same Double Degree survey, which noted that the most popular elective courses were also deemed as the most useless. This is because as intriguing as the subject may be, the nature of the course provides little to no contribution to a student’s overarching educational objective. Students engage knowing the content will fade to irrelevance within the span of a term, while being pressured to refocus on other, more promising subjects of higher importance. This issue compounds with a compulsory elective’s potential to revoke opportunities by lowering one’s GPA. Taking a course that neither plays to students’ strengths nor contributes to their dedicated capabilities can only jeopardize their success in university and further detriment their future lives. The injustice stems from introducing an academically impactful yet realistically impractical course that draws intrigue until it suddenly threatens your wellbeing. These two factors combine to leave a bitter aftertaste, and constitutes the students’ injustice.\\n\\nIt should be noted that I am not against compulsory courses. Courses that are highly relevant to completing my degree are always welcomed, and should rightfully be made compulsory. In the same Double Degree survey, when respondents indicated what they thought was the most redundant compulsory course, none answered with Math or Computer Science. Though courses such as Math 135 are infamously known to be challenging and disliked by most, students are willing to endure because they recognize its value. This is the notion of the academic injustice of compulsory “electives”. At the bare minimum, if an elective course is made to be compulsory, it should be taught at a level that justifies its existence as a compulsory course. Even if students are not immediately convinced of its value, they deserve at least instructors who are convinced of its worth, and wish to convey their convictions to who they teach. Ultimately, students come to university to learn regardless of the course, as they would otherwise not demonstrate the effort to attend lectures, complete assignments, and work for assessments. Just as students are not here only for their degree, educators should not simply educate by treating their job description like a checklist. If not, then the greatest injustice in the compulsory electives within the current education system is the collateral damage resulting from the instigator’s disinterest. \\n\\nUWaterloo is an amazing school, and some may even graduate without experiencing any of the injustices that I had mentioned today. However, even minor issues like these are important. These injustices that remain subtle, yet pervasive, should not be given the opportunity to fester for the sake of the whole student body.'),\n",

Ie. roots only sells clothes, hudson bay sells assortment\\nPricing: Some retailers sell at a discount while others at a premium. It can affect how customers perceive the brand\\nDistribution intensity: the number of outlets where the product is sold. Convenience goods would use intensive distribution while speciality goods would use exclusive distribution\\nSize and selection: The size of the retailer\\n\\nNot all retailers are a good fit for all products\\n\\nChoosing the right retail partner:\\nWhat types of stores does our target market shop at\\nAre we wanting intensive, selective, or exclusive distribution\\nDo we prefer low volume at a high profit margin, or high volume at a low profit margin\\nIs the retail environment a fit for our brand\\n\\nChoosing the right online retailer:\\nDo my customers shop at this site?\\nIs this retailer’s pricing strategy a fit for the brand?\\nIs the online shopping experience a fit for the brand?\\nDoes the site’s web traffic and delivery capability serve the needs of our company?\\n\\nNon-store retailing:\\nSelling that does not take place in conventional store facilities - customers purchase products without visiting a store\\nDirect selling: Selling products to customers through door to door sales\\nDirect marketing: catalog marketing, direct-response marketing, telemarketing, television home shopping, online marketing\\nAutomatic vending - vending machines\\n\\nThree primary functions of physical distribution:\\nInventory management \\nDeciding how much of each type of inventory to keep on hand\\nOrdering receiving, tracking\\nToo much inventory means more storage costs, too little causes stock outs\\nGoal: low inventory levels, while preventing stockouts\\nWalmart minimizes inventory costs. They influence their own supply chain\\nWarehousing\\nReceiving and storing goods, preparing for shipment\\nIe. amazon. \\nOptimizes design of warehouses to package and deliver goods\\nGoals: efficient handing of goods, efficient distribution of goods\\nTransportation\\nShipments through distribution channel to customer\\nTrains, planes ships, trucks\\nGoal: best tradeoff of speed and cost.

However in a struggling economy, businesses must cut prices\\nThe industry\\nMonopolies can charge higher prices\\nStage of product life cycle\\nProduct at the beginning of its life cycle can be charged higher\\n\\nThree key pricing considerations\\nCost\\nMax. price consumers are willing to pay\\nWhat competitors charge\\n\\n\\nBreak even point:\\nThe minimum numbers a company must sell to cover all costs\\nFixed costs: incurred no matter how many units are produced or sold\\nVariable cost: varies with the level of production and equals the variable cost per unit times the number of units produced \\nContribution margin: The profit you make per unit\\n\\nPricing objectives\\n\\n5 common pricing objectives:\\nBuild loyal customer base\\nManagement may decide to accept leaner margins in hopes a lower price would attract more attention. Makes use of add-on products\\nIncrease market share:\\nDone through aggressive pricing and monitoring the competition\\nCommunicate brand value\\nHigh prices may communicate quality and brand value\\nMaintain status quo\\nIe. the airline industry all price similarly together, as starting a price war benefits no one. \\nSurvival or liquidation\\nSetting prices below the breakeven point or below the unit cost of the product. Increases company cash flow on a short term. \\n\\n4 categories of pricing strategies:\\nNew product pricing\\nPrice skimming: charging the highest possible price for a product during introduction phase to recover R&D costs\\npenetration pricing: selling new products at low prices. To gain market share, sales volume\\nPsychological pricing\\nOdd number pricing (odd numbers slightly below whole number amounts)\\nmultiple unit pricing (single price for two or more units)\\nreference pricing (pricing at a moderate level, then placing next to an expensive model)\\nbundle pricing (packaging together two or more products, to be sold for a single price\\neveryday low prices (low price for products on a consistent basis rather than discounting)\\ncustomary prices (prices based on tradition)\\nProduct-line pries\\nCaptive pricing (basic price is low, actual price is high. Ie printer ink)\\npremium pricing (highest quality product is given the highest price)\\nprice lining (sell goods at determinate pricing that suggests price breaks. Ie selling ties only at $22 and $37)\\nPromotional pricing\\nPrice leaders (only some items are priced below the usual markup, near cost, or below cost. Used in supermarkets and restaurants)\\nspecial-event pricing (promotional pricing linked to a holiday, season, or event)\\ncomparison discounting (setting the price at a specific level and comparing it with a higher price, ie the retailers previous price) \\n\\n\\nChapter 15: Promotion mix\\n\\nPromotion mix: the combination of promotional methods a company uses to reach a target market\\n\\nThe makeup of a promotion mix depends on the company’s promotional resources and objectives, the nature of the target market, and the product’s characteristics. \\n\\nComponents of the promotional mix: \\nAdvertising: a paid message communicated to an audience through a mass medium ie television\\nPersonal selling: using sales reps directly with consumers. More persuasive but lesser reach. \\nSales promotion: incentives to encourage purchase of a product\\nPublic relations: activities to maintain favourable relationships between a company and the public. Could create good publicity or bad publicity\\n\\nIt isn’t uncommon for multiple components to be used simultaneously. \\n\\nMajor categories of advertising media:\\nTelevision\\nDirect mail\\nNewspaper\\nRadio\\n\\nImportance of advertising\\nCompanies spend billions annually. Much of advertising is allocated to online advertising\\nThe promotional tool of choice because it offers scale, targeting, choice, and accessibility\\nAdvertising media different in terms of reach, ability to target specific audiences, costs, etc.\\n\\nPersonal selling:\\nMost adaptable - seller can modify to fit the buyer\\nMost expensive because it involves working with individual or small groups of customers\\nWell for selling high-dollar goods and services\\nSteps:\\nProspecting, approaching the prospect, making the presentation, answering objections, closing the sale, following up with the customer\\n\\nSales promotion:\\nMarketing efforts or sales efforts, not including advertising, personal selling, and public relations, that stimulates buying\\nExamples:\\nCoupons, samples, premiums, frequent-user incentives, point of purchase displays, sweepstakes and contests\\n\\nPromotion objectives:\\nBest method of sales promotion depends on promotional objective \\nAttract new customers (all methods)\\nEncourage trial of a product (samples)\\nBoost customer loyalty (frequent user incentives)\\nCross sell other products from your company (all methods)\\nGain attention in retail environment (point of purchase displays)\\nIdentify prospects or build customer relationships (sweepstakes and contests)\\n\\nPublic relations\\nCommunication activities used to build favourable relationships with the public. \\nMain goal: to gain media publicity\\n\\nTypes of PR tools:\\nPress release\\nNew products, interviews with company officials, reports of new discoveries, expansion into new markets, investment results\\nPress conference\\nMedia members are invited to hear news announcements, ie apple new product launches\\nEvent sponsorship\\nPromotes positive image for company\\n\\nPR advantages and disadvantages:\\nAdvantage: extremely leveraged use of money, valuable free publicity\\nDisadvantage: out of company’s control'),\n",

Meanwhile, production employees want a short product line to better manage the production line\\n\\nEstimate production capacity:\\nToo much capacity: valuable resources, equipment, and money will lie idle\\nToo little capacity: Added capacity will be more expensive, building new capacity will lose market share to competitors \\n\\nFacilities planning:\\nSelecting facility location and layout:\\nProximity to major customers. (apparel clothing/food brands might want to produce closer to the buyer, while automobile manufacturers would want to build closely too to reduce cost of shipping.  \\nAvailability of cost and labour: ie making in china to reduce costs\\nCost of construction and operation\\nIe environmental regulations of using the land\\\\\\nAccess to key resources\\n\\nDetermining a facility layout: \\nProcess layout: separate stations for distinct tasks, products move through in any sequence, low volume, customized products\\nProduct layout: Also called “assembly line”. All products undergo same operation in same sequence for high-volume, standardized production runs. \\nFixed position layout: Product usually remains stationary, people and machines move around as needed to assemble the product, used for producing large products\\n\\nSupply chain management: \\nSuccessful production depends on careful coordination and monitoring of three important aspects of operations planning and control\\nSupply chain management\\nShceduling\\nQuality control\\nSupply chain management: the coordination of members of the supply channel, from raw materials suppliers, to manufacturers, to distributors, even to retailers. \\nGoals: reliable production lead times, lower inventory levels, higher customer satisfaction\\nMaterials requirement planning: computerized system to integrate production planning and inventory control.

Customers will pay for curated fitness boxes with a certain degree of customization and novelty. The elements of curation, personalization, and surprise will strengthen our most prioritized key success factor: customer satisfaction (Shopify, 2021). As a subscription based new startup, our financial performance depends largely on customer retention rates (i.e., customer satisfaction).\\nBy investing $4000 monthly into marketing, up to $10000 in January, we expect to gain ~75-300 new users per month while leveraging seasonal fitness trends (Gymaster, 2020). We anticipate retention rates of 70% for new customers, which increase as customers continuously renew their subscriptions. This strategy will provide a predictable and recurring revenue stream that grows a loyal customer base.\\nOur strategy is viable because we expect low fixed costs. The extended shelf life of protein powder and our product’s ease of storage enables lax warehousing constraints. In addition, until sales surpass 300 monthly, we can operate rent-free in our existing facilities with no external employees. These optimizations reduce the cash break even point for each month.\\nPricing:\\nBoxes will be priced at $65 with shipping included; the COGS per box is about $44 to $47, leaving a ~30% profit margin. We anticipate that after 6 months of operations, negotiating with suppliers and distributors will allow us to lower variable costs, in particular, leveraging Shopify’s shipping discounts and making bulk input purchases (Shopify, 2022). \\nSustainability, profitability, and financial results:\\nOur 2 years sales forecast indicates no profits until after 6th months of operation; our initial investment of $10,000 will be consumed quickly. However, we expect to generate enough sales to break even starting month 6. Our forecasted cash break even point is 228-289 subscriptions monthly, which spikes every January to 575-577 due to increased operational costs. Furthermore, we will not surpass our investment until after 1 year and 7 months. Afterwards, not only will our business model be sustainable, but also profitable; we expect to have $22,000 by the end of two years of operations. Given our top down sales forecast, we would only service 3% of our SOM, which allows us to continuously grow past this point.\\n\\n\\nViability: OLD VERSION\\nRevenue Model:\\nFit-Ez follows a curation subscription e-commerce business model. Using Shopify’s existing e-commerce support system, we will service Ontario with the timely implementation of our website and access to shipping discounts. Customers will pay for curated fitness boxes with a certain degree of customization, as well as for possible surprises included within. The elements of curation, personalization, and surprise are the key success factors behind customer satisfaction and retention in our model. \\nAs a subscription based new startup, our top priorities will be customer acquisition and customer retention. By investing $4000 monthly into marketing, we expect to gain ~75 new users per month. Our conservative retention rates anticipate 70% one time users containing 75% single-month users, with declining percentages of longer term users. In addition, we anticipate taking additional December loans for increased January marketing in order to accommodate the seasonal fitness boom. This strategy will provide a predictable revenue stream, increase the cash on hand, and leverage the network effect. \\nPricing:\\nBoxes will be priced at $65, while shipping will be offered free. The cost of shipping will be covered by the initial price of the box. The contents of the box will be worth ~$44 to $47 leaving a ~30% profit margin. We anticipate that improving supplier and distributor negotiations, gradual operational stability, and growing economies of scale will allow us to lower variable costs after 6 months of business. \\nSustainability and profitability:\\nOur 2 years sales forecast indicates no profits until past our 6th month of operations. While cash will be consumed quickly in our first 8 months of operations, we expect to accumulate sufficient cash to pay off loans in the following time. Furthermore, we will not surpass our initial investment of $20,000 in cash until 1 year and 7 months into operations. Past this point, not only will our business model be sustainable, it will also be profitable. \\nOur strategy is viable because we expect low fixed costs. The extended shelf life of protein powder and the compact occupancy of our product enables lax warehousing constraints. Consequently, until we surpass 300 monthly subscriptions expected in month 10, all onsite operations may occur rent-free (ie, someone’s basement). In addition, no external employees outside the founders will be hired, and founders will not pay themselves. These assumptions reduce fixed costs during months 1-9 to strictly marketing and Shopify fees. With this strategy, we expect to break even by month 6, and have nearly $22,000 by the end of the second year of operations. \\n\\n\\nWorks Cited:\\nHow to start a subscription business: A brief guide.

And though we continue to promise ourselves “never again”, the unexplainable allure of internet pornography keeps us coming time and time again. However, despite its ever-high rates of consumption, what remains unknown are the aftereffects of pornography. To supplement this vital piece of sex education, and to prevent the spread of misinformation, I believe that consuming porn is fine when done in moderation. \\n\\nThe current stigma around internet pornography is highly polarized. Coined as “The New Drug”, common belief suggests pornography consumption at younger ages encourages riskier sexual behaviour, and may act as an instigator for sexual violence. However, numerous recent studies done by Croatian and Swiss researchers have results that dispute this claim. Not only did earlier ages of pornographic exposure have no correlation with riskier and violent behaviour, it conversely had an educational effect on sexual conduct and orientation. This is further supported by empirical evidence, as after pornography was legalized in Denmark in 1969, sexual aggression reportedly declined. The conclusions from these studies opposes the conventional views on pornography held by many. \\n\\nHowever, many may still be wary of porn for its addictive properties. After all, a commonly cited argument is that consuming porn activates the same pleasure circuits as when consuming cocaine. While this is true, increasing evidence suggests that porn is not an addiction. Rather, a UCLA study conducted in 2014 found that porn “addicts” lacked the same emotional engagement present in responses of drug addicts. That is, a key characterization of mental addictions common to drugs and gambling was not found in porn addicts when stimulated. This distinction has even led the DSM-V, the arbitrator and official criteria of mental disorders, to not classify porn addictions as a mental disorder. \\n\\nRather, a 2020 study written in the Journal of American Psychology suggests that porn addictions may be the result of compulsion and personal values. Researchers in this study noted that people’s cultural, moral, and religious values may cause them to believe they overconsume porn, even when they consume just as much as average. To put into perspective, the peculiarly high numbers of homosexuals and bisexuals who were self-proclaimed porn addicts suggests that “porn addiction” may be cultural issue rather than a clinical issue. \\n\\nIn the end, the question comes down to:”how much is too much?”. Though individuals may vary, the answer returns to the individual’s idea of moderation. As Gail Saltz, a professor at the New York School of Medicine, says, a sexual behaviour becomes a disorder when “it impairs a person’s functioning and keeps them from living the life they want.” \\nAnd so, for all of you self proclaimed porn addicts out there, you can’t recover from an addiction that isn’t an addiction. However, you can consume responsibly and in moderation.'),\n",

Rather than following the quarterly-focused, efficacy-based practices of convention, purposeful companies possess goals with multi-generational timelines. While this may strain relations between stakeholders who seek immediate results, it conversely captures the attention of investors seeking sustainable ROI and transparency. A further challenge is the meaningful implementation of purpose. Results from a recent survey [a1] indicate a “purpose gap” between companies and employees: while 82% agree upon the importance of having a purpose, only 42% admitted their organizations’ purpose statements drove impact. This may lead to negative public backlash, including accusations of “purpose washing[a2] ”. To avoid this risk, Tesla is an example of a company who correctly applies the purpose-driven approach.\\nTesla – commitment, transparency, community through purpose:\\nTesla’s success became apparent to the world throughout the pandemic, as its growth kept reaching new highs while typical businesses were on the decline. This is partially attributed to Tesla’s powerful purpose-driven approach.\\nCommitment: Tesla’s primary goal, as outlined on its website, is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy”. For example, while it is unclear whether the Tesla Cybertruck was an overall success, the motive of “creating a market[a3] ” via sustainable means demonstrates that profit is not a priority; rather, it is the fuel that accomplishes Tesla’s purpose.\\n\\n [a1]Corporate purpose: Shifting from why to how | McKinsey\\n [a2]Dear Business Roundtable CEOs: Some tips on avoiding purpose-washing | Corporate Knights\\n [a3]Elon Musk: Tesla Cybertruck Created With Zero Market Research, Could Flop (insideevs.com)'),\n",

To survive in the business world, your company must be grounded in moral purpose and guided by the goals of offering value to customers, contributing to society, living in harmony with nature and creating a better future. The most basic need you are compelled to meet as a business is social connection. CEO of Fast Retailing, Tadashi Yanai is guided by 23 management principles he calls the “soul” of his company. The “soul” describes the simple truths and principles that guide us to do what is right as human beings, helping us find our way through uncertainty and hardship. The “brain” refers to the analysis that will help companies operate in a messy world and wend their way through its complexities and ambiguities. By starting with the soul, companies can crystalize how they are going to achieve their purpose of making a better future for everyone. Drawing on deeply held values, companies can imagine what kind of future they wish to create and then use their brains to make it happen.\\n\\n6 Practices That Infuse Strategy With Soul\\nCope with Complexity: To solve complex problems, we must tap both analytical and intuitive thinking to address it, as no single approach or field of study will provide the answers. \\nAdapt to Change: Accelerated technological progress is creating a demand for leaders and organizations to anticipate and adapt to new circumstances at a pace unprecedented in human history\\nEmbrace Dynamic Duality: Using both explicit knowledge (can easily be articulated and shared) and tacit knowledge (intuitive and gained from lived experience) forms a dynamic duality interacting with, and interchingn into, each other to create something new through life experiences. \\nEmpathize With Everyone: Social connection is top priority and business leaders need to be able to develop keen understanding of others’ perspectives and cultivate compassion in our hearts.  \\nTell Stories:  Effective business leaders understand the power of using stories to communicate the essence of their beliefs and ideals and to help the organization internalize strategy\\nLive With Nature: As a business leader we should respect our earth and seek to repair the damage to our natural environment caused by industrialization.\\nConclusion: A leader who begins by establishing a deeper purpose for the organization - and is guided by that purpose rather than a strategy of, say, market dominance - can more clearly see emerging trends and successfully adapt to them.\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'RSM writeup good copy', 'date': '2021-11-02T21:45:10.656Z'}, page_content='To: Rhonda Kinsler\\nFrom: Anthony Ho\\nSubject: Viability of gamification as an alternative online work design\\nDate: November 4, 2021\\n\\nRecommendation: Sustaining Company Culture Via Virtual Gamification\\n\\nAs technology advances, companies are searching for the ideal work design of in-person versus remote activities that caters specifically towards Generation (Gen) Z employees. This is motivated by increasing demand for more flexible work1, including options for remote work2. This recommendation proposes rearrangements to RSM’s work design using virtual gamification to provide an optimal workspace maximizing employee performance and satisfaction. See Exhibit 1 for a detailed explanation. This strategy is expected to establish a connectivity between all employees and RSM culture, maintain RSM’s brand promise with clients and employees, and generate desirability as an employer, specifically with Gen Zs. \\nDecision Criteria:\\n\\nThe most effective solution was chosen considering these 3 decision criteria:\\nEstablish connectivity between employee and RSM culture from anywhere\\nMaintain RSM’s brand promise and image between clients and employees\\nGenerate desirability as an employer, specifically towards Gen Zs \\n\\nAnalysis:\\nGamification strengthens company culture, even when applied remotely\\n\\nGamified systems are shown to have positive effects on work, engagement, and learning3. By establishing gamified systems online where rewards may encourage RSM culture, such as meals with executives or seminar invitations, employees will remain connected to RSM culture even when working online or in-person. An added effect is the increased conversation which arises from reward and competition, which develops camaraderie and communication amongst employees. This is suitable for Gen Z hires, whose desires to learn and work purposefully4 will be supported by competition and reward incentives. The “game” itself (See Exhibit 2) is a disguised public progress-check, implemented in an engaging manner to motivate and showcase outstanding workers. The quantitative performance indicators allow role models to be formed, which revitalizes aspects of mentorship, self-development, and distinction among employees.3 This gamified system provides the organic means for new and existing hires to interact with and develop RSM culture. \\n\\nA flexible work design maintains brand promise by satisfying both employees and clients\\n\\nStudies show that while clients overwhelmingly prefer in-person interactions, employees value greater flexibility in their time schedules1. As a gamified online workspace does not replace the on-site environment, scheduled shifts allow employees to easily organise in-person meetings with clients, thus providing clients with the same levels of service pre-pandemic. This is comparable to the full-online virtual office alternative, see Exhibit 3. In addition, shorter work days provide the flexibility and company employees seek. Surveys indicate that though employees and Gen Zs support virtual work, a large majority work regardless from home1. Thus, shorter work days scheduled at easier times provides the work flexibility that employees desire.  This further addresses employee loneliness from virtual work1, as the limited time spent at work encourages more frequent communication between employees. See Exhibit 4 for more details regarding the on-site work design. \\n\\nThis work design generates appeal towards Gen Zs by considering their characteristics\\n\\nSurveys on Gen Z lifestyles have revealed Gen Z hires typically lack the financial means to create an adequate workspace at home5. Along with their reported increases in stress4, enforcing professional attitudes at home via webcam monitoring is suggested to further overwhelm individuals and increase fatigue6. A non-invasive connection from work to home via a gamified RSM encourages the thought of working from home as an opportunity rather than as an obligation. By allowing employees to adopt a casual attitude from home, employees further practice RSM culture by being their “authentic selves”7 within a pseudo-work environment. This freedom allows employees to effectively “unplug” and recuperate from work, and generates desirability by differentiating RSM as an accommodating and employee-valuing employer. \\n\\nImplementation plan\\n\\nImmediately, we must flesh out the logistics of gamified online workspace, including arrangements for  the game rewards, ie. seeking permission from others as reward items, and commence software development on the gamified system. At ~3 months, after the completed gamification of online work, employees should gradually transition towards the proposed gamified work design at limited locations. After 1 year, feedback of the new work design should be collected and nuances with the gamification should be resolved. See Exhibit 5 for a more detailed implementation plan. \\n\\nRisks and Contingency Plan\\n\\nSeveral risks were identified and addressed in Exhibit 6. The primary risk is the lack of immediate incentive for new and existing hires to engage with the game. As the game’s actual purpose is to incentivise forming connections and self-development, this risk can be mitigated by basing rewards off employee-surveyed preferences. A contingency plan is to provide direct monetary value goods, (meals, vouchers), and reconsider rewards to incentivise workers to engage with the game. (eg. more tangible rewards)\\nExhibit 1: A detailed explanation of the gamified work design\\nOverview and rationale of virtual gamification:\\nMinimal at home zoom meetings. As Gen Zs are usually living with others, their one safe space would be their own room, which is often limited in size. \\nMinimal camera usage to respect privacy, since employees may feel pressured to activate cameras to demonstrate respect. Increased employee stress and fatigue will not bring the company many benefits. \\nEncourage competitiveness, which may boost productivity and work quality\\nIncentives may be tied to Gen Z goals. Ex. career development, self-development, de-stressing opportunities\\nRecognition from rewards facilitate natural workplace conversations, including feedback from superiors, chatter between employees, adoration towards mentors. \\n\\nOverview and rationale of on-site scheduling/work changes: \\nBecause of the requirement of RSM’s on-site operations, we are unable to offer full accomodation, like google. Our locations are required to be spread apart from each other, thus our method of differentiation will be our flexible hours. \\nPeople are not required to stay for long at work. However, they are still paid for the additional hours they stay. People may choose to stay late if they are working on a group project. \\nAs management is usually isolated from individual tasks, managers should be required to stay in their office due to their increased importance in operations. Managers may nonetheless benefit from shortened working hours, as employees are recommended to seek guidance earlier in the work day. \\nCulture is maintained due to the scheduled time people are supposed to arrive on site. In addition, clients may prefer in-person meetings, which is more convenient if all members are consistently on-site on a regular basis.\\nManagement and project leaders are to decide the rewards associated with the gamification system. \\n\\n\\n\\nExhibit 2: A sample gamified layout, with annotations\\nExhibit 3: Alternatives Matrix\\n\\nExhibit 4: Breakdown of a typical work day\\n\\nAdditional notes:\\nExisting social activities are encouraged to occupy the majority of on-site time, ie. ENG meetings, casual hobby clubs. This is intended to develop company culture\\nPeople may remain on-site after 3:00PM to work on group work or meet with clients. In this case, group leaders would notify group members their time expectations\\nAs all employees are scheduled to arrive within the same time interval, this implies easier group meetings with clients and possible human interactions between anyone\\n\\nExhibit 5: Detailed implementation plan in Gantt format\\n\\nExhibit 6: Risks and contingencies\\n\\n\\nReferences\\nBuffer.

Expansion into the hunting segment will be beneficial for WIN, as it is an opportunity for WIN to achieve brand recognition, expand their operations and become more profitable, and satisfies their industry’s wants while aligning with their company strengths.\\n\\nDecision criteria:\\nAchieve brand recognition (widely used) through high quality goods\\nExpand operations and profitability and respond to foreign companies.\\nAccommodate consumer trends while aligning with company strengths\\n\\nAlternatives were compared in Exhibit 1, which included analysis on expanding into the water sports segment, the golf segment, and competitor acquisition.\\n\\nAnalysis:\\nWIN’s reputation for their high quality goods is transferable to the hunting products they can manufacture, which provides more brand recognition.\\n\\nWIN may leverage their vacant manufacturing capacity by expanding into a new industry, which attracts new consumers and provides reliable profits.\\n\\nRecent trends favour increased involvement in the hunting segment, providing expected high returns for new entrants, particularly for female hunters. \\n\\nImplementation plan:\\nWe must first develop our new hunting product prototypes, which will attempt to differentiate from the competition using innovative and modern designs in order to mitigate the risk from foreign competitors. After 4 months, after prototype design with the help of experienced hunters and engineers, we must commence a marketing campaign with themes of women empowerment through the hockey sporting goods we already offer in order to garner attention for our new product line for hunting. At the same time, we must utilize our vacant productive capacity to begin making our new line of hunting products. In the long run, after selling our product to our existing retailers and gaining seasonal revenue streams, we may consider expanding into more female sports equipment. \\n\\nRisks and contingency plan:\\nA primary risk is the threat of foreign competitors. A mitigation plan is to leverage Canadian pride to support local manufacturers via marketing. A contingency plan would be to consider niche-r markets who would value safety and and technological innovation over price based competition.

This recommendation proposes rearrangements to RSM’s work design using purposeful scheduling and virtual gamification to provide an optimal workspace maximizing employee performance and satisfaction. This strategy is expected to improve work experience for all age cohorts working at RSM, generate desirability towards RSM as an employer, and establish a harmonious dependency between virtual and physical work. \\n\\nDecision Criteria and Alternatives:  -add alternatives later\\nFeatures and qualities an ideal solution will possess\\n\\nEstablish a connectivity between employee and RSM culture, regardless of work location\\nMaintain RSM’s brand promise and level of quality between clients and employees\\nUtilize technology to appeal towards Gen Z new hires, and generate desirability as an employer\\n\\nAnalysis:\\nWhy your solution aligns with the decision criteria set out\\n\\nEnculture, not assimilate:\\nWidely acknowledged firms like Google, Apple, and Facebook encourage both communication and connection between employees, as seen in their contemporary work designs. These methods are not flawless, however, as their employees have reportedly felt forced to model their lifestyles after company preferences. A non-intrusive work design is ideal for RSM culture, for its employees to “be their authentic selves”. A small change, such as eliminating cameras during calls, would help separate the idea of “work” from “home”. Employees would feel less pressured to maintain in-person standards after hours, thus reducing fatigue and raising satisfaction. This is specifically pertinent to Gen Z hires, as their age and financial position result in situations where their home environment may not be ideal as a professional environment (roommates, limited/untidy housing space). By having a weaker association between “work” and “home”, employees will have a greater appreciation towards RSM culture as their personal lives would not interfere with their profession, resulting in added desirability as an employer and increased commitment as an employee. \\n\\nCompete for improvement:\\nRecent studies have shown that gamification of work demonstrates positive effects on both learning and performance. The implementation of RSM Online, a gamified system of an employee’s virtual work, is ideal for RSM because it fosters the communication and culture otherwise lacking in online work. In practice, RSM Online is a hub of assignments and opportunities, and is a means to encourage both communication and productivity. It provides all hires a universal commonality, becoming an easy conversation topic to bridge connections between employees of all levels. Furthermore, its gamified system aligns with the characteristics and abilities of Gen Z hires. The resulting competition provides the sense of purpose Gen Zs seek in job opportunities, motivating them to produce quality results. The rewards from “playing the game” could be pertinent to Gen Z motivations, such as career development or a monetary reward. For example, the hypothetical reward: “lunch with a manager”, develops a connection between mentor and student, and further creates a natural setting to discuss career advancing projects. Within RSM, gamification compensates for lack of interactions in a digital workplace by providing additional reasons for communication.\\n\\nDerive Meaning in Person:\\nPre-pandemic polls demonstrated overall favourability towards remote work, and even experts have confirmed this inevitable transition. However, due to RSM’s nature as a people’s business, in-person interactions are irreplaceable. I recommend a flexible work design focused on creating meaningful in-person interactions, where employees are required to check-in 4 times a week for shortened periods of time. By scheduling a designated time where people are required to arrive, RSM will be better prepared to meet with clients, who are statistically shown to prefer in-person meets. In addition, everyone’s presence will allow important information to be easily debriefed, and team projects to be swiftly resumed. Within these hours of in-person work, company culture may be fostered in a similar manner to pre-pandemic levels, but now requires important details to be mentioned at earlier times of day. Only the individuals who wish to stay late remain at the office, thus providing the highly desirable work flexibility amongst employees. This work design maintains RSM’s culture while raising the time value spent on-site, thus satisfying Gen Z’s needs for a purposeful use of time. \\n\\n\\n\\n. \\n\\nEstablish a connectivity between employee and RSM culture, regardless of work environment (remote or in-person interaction)\\n\\nGamified systems are shown to have positive effects on work, engagement, and learning. By establishing gamified systems online where rewards may encourage RSM culture, such as meals with executives or seminar invitations, employees will remain connected to RSM culture even when working online. An added effect is the increased conversation that arises from competition, which may increase camaraderie and communication amongst employees. This is suitable for Gen Z employees, whose desires to learn and work purposefully will be supported by competitiveness and reward incentives. \\n\\n\\n\\nMaintain RSM’s brand promise between clients and employees (the power of being understood)\\nHelp employees feel valued and happy working for the companyHelp employees feel valued and happy working for the company\\n\\nA hybrid model of spending shorter yet more meaningful time on-site satisfies both client and employee preferences. It is statistically shown that while clients overwhelmingly value in-person interactions, employees value greater flexibility in their time schedules. Shorter, yet more flexible work days allows teams to meet as a cohesive unit to respect clients, reproduces the company culture within the office, and encourages better use of time. By increasing the time value spent on-site, employees and clients will know that RSM values their preferences and makes the most of their time. \\n\\nUse technology to appeal towards Gen Z new hires and co-op students, and generate desirability as an employer\\n\\nSurveys on Gen Z lifestyles have revealed Gen Z hires tend to lack the financial means to create an adequate workspace at home. Along with their reported increases in stress, enforcing professional attitudes at home via webcam monitoring is suggested to further overwhelm individuals and increase fatigue. A non-invasive connection from work to home via a gamified RSM encourages the thought of working as an opportunity rather than as an obligation. This freedom will allow employees to effectively “unplug” from work, and differentiate RSM as an accommodating and employee-valuing employer. \\n\\nImplementation plan\\n\\nImmediately, we should flesh out the logistics of gamified online workspace. We must arrange the game rewards, ie. seeking permission from others as reward items, and being software development. After completion, at ~2 months, employees should gradually be transitioned towards the proposed hybrid work design and virtual gamified system. After 1 year, feedback of the new work design should be collected and nuances with the gamification should be resolved. \\n\\nRisks and Contingency plan\\nMost important risk of the strategy\\nBrief but clear description of how you will mitigate it\\n3-4 sentences\\n\\nThe primary risk is the lack of immediate incentive for new and existing hires to engage with the game. As the game’s actual purpose is to incentivise forming connections and self-development, this risk can be mitigated by supplying limited time credits for new users to encourage employee interaction. A contingency plan is to provide direct monetary value goods, (meals, vouchers), and reconsider rewards to incentivise workers to engage with the game. \\n\\nGame features:\\nLeaderboards\\nRequired tasks\\nProgress bar\\nRewards\\nCurrency\\nVoice chats'),\n",

I can’t imagine how we would have managed through COVID  lockdowns without it.”  \\nShe was looking forward to this conversation with Lindsay Helmers, an Assurance  Manager with RSM, Daniel Booth, National Campus Recruitment Lead, and the recent  hires and co-op students that would be joining the call. After everyone joined and spent  some time catching up, checking in and getting to know one another, Rhonda focused  the group on the topic at hand. \\nI’m glad to hear that everyone is doing well. I can’t believe there are  people on this call that I have only seen through a computer screen.  Hopefully we will be able to meet in person soon, which is why I wanted to  connect with you today. COVID has posed some challenges for managing  human resources, in particular, ensuring everyone is engaged, bonding  with each other and fully experiencing our awesome company culture. At  the same time, it has highlighted some opportunities - everyone is saying  they love the flexibility RSM offers and the fact that they don’t have to  waste time commuting to the office every day. We’ve also been able to \\n* This case was written by Sofy Carayannopoulos for academic training. It is not intended to indicate effective or  ineffective management practices.

How (and what) technology can be harnessed to make work  at RSM a great experience for our staff, in particular, our Generation Z  new hires and co-op students? How should it be used to make work lives  better, easier and productive?  \\nBefore opening the floor to discussion, Klosler took a moment to remind everyone of a  few key points: \\nThe objective is to help employees feel valued and happy working for the  company. RSM’s aspiration is to ultimately be the most desirable employer in  Canada. \\nThe ideal solution will balance the flexibility to work remotely with the need for  interaction and bonding between employees. It will align with and build the RSM  culture. This connectivity is how RSM wants to differentiate itself in our industry. \\nRSM \\nRSM provides audit, tax and consulting services to middle market companies, and the  firm’s competitors are the big accounting and advisory firms (see Exhibit 1 - RSM  competitors for details). \\nPrior to the launch of RSM in the Canadian market and re-brand as RSM Canada, its  predecessor firm operated as the tenth largest firm in its industry in Canada with a rich  60 year history. In 2018, the predecessor firm joined RSM International, a global  network of independent audit, tax and consulting firms, and became RSM Canada LLP.  \\nBy 2021, RSM International had more than 12,000 employees in North America and  over 43,000 world-wide. It operates in 120 countries and is considered a leader in  advising middle market leaders2 globally.  \\nRSM Canada currently has offices in Red Deer, Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto. In  2020, the firm achieved $100 million in revenue with 727 employees3. Unlike its  competitors, RSM’s intention is to have integrated offices in the major markets in  Canada – Toronto, Calgary/Edmonton, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver - with a  national alliance of independent firms that help serve the rest of Canada. Located in \\nAlberta and Toronto, the firm is focusing on building its presence in Vancouver, the next  major English-speaking market in Canada.  \\nRSM culture and employee focus \\nThe company’s brand promise is to deliver “The Power of Being Understood.” This  guides how the company wants clients and employees to feel and be treated. RSM had  identified key behaviours (“5 Cs) that were central to delivering the Power of Being  Understood and these were now a large and deeply rooted part of the company culture  (see Exhibit 2 for a visual depiction of the 5Cs and a link to an explainer video). Caring (deep focus on customer) \\nCollaborative (work with and support each other and the client)  Curious (innovative) \\nCritical thinking (truly understanding the client needs)  \\nCourageous (think beyond boundaries; challenge) \\nThe 5Cs applies to all stakeholders throughout their relationship with RSM, including  recruiting new employees because these were the desired characteristics of RSM  advisors. As Klosler pointed out,  \\n“We’re a people business - we are only as good as the people that work  with our clients. Our priority is [therefore] always our people first. But  delivering on the “Power of Being Understood” and applying the 5Cs  approach extends to our clients and is our differentiator – asking  \\nquestions, bringing in other experts/perspectives as needed.” \\nWork environment and culture \\nThe values that they embrace as an organization are respect, integrity, teamwork,  excellence and stewardship4. \\nRSM acts on its core value of stewardship by committing to operate in an  environmentally responsible way but also by giving back to the community. Its various  corporate social responsibility activities are outlined here. The organization has  supported various charitable causes and events throughout the year and encouraged its  employees to do the same. For example, in 2020 RSM Canada had raised $220,000  through its annual stewardship campaign - Birdies for Love. These funds help support  various organizations whose mandate is to enhance education or quality of life for  children and families (see https://rsmcanada.com/newsroom/news-releases/2020/rsm-\\ncanada-donates-more-than-220000-through-2020-birdies-fore-lo.html for further  information).  \\nRSM describes its work environment as one where everyone feels comfortable being  who they are, in other words, to be their authentic selves (see Exhibit 3 - RSM  Recruiting brochure for details on how this is communicated to new recruits). The focus  is on authenticity combined with the “Power of Being Understood,” and to address the  unique needs and aspirations of each employee (see the information provided at this  link for additional details https://rsmus.com/who-we-are/our-values/rsm-talent experience.html). The pillars of the firm’s human resource practices were: flexibility,  career development, inclusiveness and understanding.  \\nRSM’s approach to human resource management focuses on an ideology that each  employee needs to “own your own future”. When new employees join the organization,  they are connected with career advisors and partners to identify areas of interest,  ambitions and how to achieve their career objectives. They are asked to share what  path they want to take so that they could be supported in building the expertise for that  path. Within their first year, they are asked to identify two industries they are interested  in and want to focus on so they could become subject matter experts. They can attend  local, national and US-based conferences that are focused on the employee’s identified  interests. Pre-COVID, everyone would go to Chicago for training with the purpose of not  only learning more about their industry of choice but also to build networks and a  community across North America. There is a strong focus on getting designations as  well and the firms provides paid time off to study and write exams, pay for education, and work with an external vendor to prepare for exams, resulting in a 98% pass rate.  \\nPromoting inclusion and diversity begins with the leadership team and is driven by  Employee Networking Groups (ENGs) that centre on different themes. The ENGs are  driven by employees and their purpose is to create community and a forum for  understanding by bringing employees that have similar interests or backgrounds  together. ENGs are encouraged to create events in which all employees can participate.  The events promote networking, professional development, mentorship, and education  that fosters understanding and respect for members. For example, to foster learning  and growth, ENGs might facilitate “courageous conversations” around their themes,  during which employees can ask any questions that they were struggling with, without  being judged. Courageous conversations focuses on timely topics, including mental  health and systemic racism, and have included external speakers as well as internal  speakers from across North America to aid understanding. Approximately 60% of staff  and partners have chosen to become part of an ENG.\\nLeaders are always present and involved in ENG events. The enthusiasm, engagement  and participation rates of top leaders in organized social activities are comparable to  those of newer employees.  \\nThere are also no barriers between the various levels of the organization, so an  employee anywhere within RSM can reach out to anyone else in the organization for  help, advice and information, regardless of the individual’s position. The camaraderie  and casualness of interactions between employees is not hindered by differences in  where they are on the organizational hierarchy.  \\nRSM’s approach to its employees has been recognized with various awards. In 2021 it  was named one of “Greater Toronto’s Top Employers”1 and in 2020 was recognized  among Canada’s “Most Admired Cultures5”  \\nThe job \\nRSM’s growth is fueled by its partners who build relationships while leveraging teams to  execute on the deliverables with clients.  \\nManagers and their teams work with clients. Consequently, employees collaborate and  coordinate with each other, even as they complete their individual responsibilities. In  addition, sub-groups within lines of business are set up so that they can become subject  matter experts and connect with fellow colleagues in the same area who work on the  same tasks. \\nRather than have employees focus on specific tasks for a variety of projects, they are  given line of sight from cradle to grave on projects so they understand the entire  deliverable and their role in it. Letting employees be involved in all client activities  ensures employees see the value and impact of their work.  \\nTo acknowledge and reward performance, employees are provided fast feedback and  internal points and recognition, “accolades6”, can be awarded to anyone by anyone.  \\nCOVID hits \\nPrior to COVID, it was easy for staff and partners to organically connect and experience  the culture of the organization. It was easier to share stories and ask questions as  people worked side-by-side, passed each other in hallways, or while taking coffee \\nbreaks. You could read quotes on the office walls and participate in various in-person  events throughout the day. \\nQuite suddenly in March 2020, COVID was confirmed a global pandemic. Governmental  responses across the world varied widely, but in Canada the Prime Minister announced  the first in a series of stay-at-home orders, forcing businesses to move employees to  work from home wherever possible. RSM’s top priority was to keep its employees safe  while figuring out how to service clients right in the middle of the busiest time of year.  Canadian leadership had to jump into action and within 24 hours had 727 employees  and partners set up to work remotely. Employees were “tooled up and trained up” on  Webex and other online platforms to support clients and their needs. This was not an  easy task and required trust, solid leadership and lots of online training on how to use  WebEx more efficiently, access the tools online and connect to teams and clients in a  new space.  \\nRhonda Klosler shared that leadership, “over-communicated so our people understood  where we were going and what decisions were being made at all times”. \\nRSM’s IT and HR team quickly identified how to virtually onboard new hires and set  them up with the equipment they needed (ex. laptops) so that were ready to go from  their first day on the job. All new hires went through extensive virtual training with  collaboration with colleagues across Canada and the U.S.  \\nExternally, RSM had to pivot to address clients’ needs and opportunities in a new way.  Audit and tax functions had to be moved completely online and the consulting line of  business, which was now outpacing the other two lines of business on growth, had to  focus on technology, digital capabilities, and infrastructure for technology because  clients now needed this support to build new skill sets.  \\nInitially, technology was the biggest challenge. Employees were given as much support  as needed but they were also asked to give themselves grace. They were used to being  the best in what they do and struggled to give themselves time to adjust in this new  environment. They were encouraged to reach out for help and told that it was okay if  everything wasn’t perfect. There were regular touchpoint meetings to check-in with  employees/teams and make sure they had what they needed for their jobs and  themselves. \\nOnce the organization found its rhythm with remote working, it pivoted to creating  community. There were quarterly calls to bring different ENG communities together. \\nSocial activities such as virtual escape rooms and an online Second City comedy night  were organized.  \\nRSM was also cognizant of Zoom/WebEx fatigue so they started putting boundaries on  expectations, i.e. don’t answer emails after a certain time in the evening, block a lunch  break to step away from work and your computer, take meetings as calls rather than  videos, and try “walking meetings” outside. They began using breakout rooms and  surveys to capture thoughts and opinions to ensure all voices were being heard and  many are hesitant to speak up in large, remote groups. The firm moved their summer  leadership program online and held it virtually across Canada. In 2020, the focus was  on what technology could be used so the experience didn’t look clunky - they used more  cameras, integrated surveys and used breakout rooms to create a more comfortable  experience.  \\nRecruiting new talent was done completely online and there was an important silver  lining: RSM was able to attract excellent talent from remote markets because  employees were not constrained by the need to travel or live near RSM’s physical  offices.  \\nIn January 2021, it was clear that RSM had been able to successfully pivot to remote  work. It was having its best year ever, growing revenue 12 to 13% year-over-year – with  tax and consulting services leading the growth particularly in areas like digital  transformation and automation. \\nGENERATION Z CHARACTERISTICS7,8 \\nGeneration Z is referred to as individuals born between 1997 and 2012. Professional  and academic achievement is generally highly valued by this generation, and they are  focused on personal growth and development. At the same time, this generation values  purpose and social responsibility. They are digital natives and have never known a time  when the internet did not exist, but they also crave in-person interaction. They want  human connections and to feel like they are part of a team. Studies suggest that when  dealing with a remote Generation Z worker, recurring meetings are good for bonding  and ensuring this person is heard. Connectivity via video calls are better than telephone  calls.  \\nWhat sets this group apart is that COVID disrupted their education and disconnected  them from their regular learning in a communal setting. The way this groups learns has  therefore been impacted which means that employers may have to reconsider their \\norientation and skill development programs in future years. In addition, the substantial  disruption to their social and educational experiences has increased their baseline  stress levels far above those of prior generations. \\nRemote versus in-person tradeoffs and issues \\nThere was a range of options between entirely remote and entirely in-office work design  (see Exhibit 4 - The In-office to Fully remote continuum). After organizations recovered  from the imposed requirement to work remotely, they began to reconsider the potential  for doing so more systematically and permanently. Large companies such as Facebook  and Twitter announced they would take a large-scale approach and that working  remotely would be permanently adopted.9 \\nHowever, it was clear that the issue was not simply a matter of offering employees  laptops and enabling video calls. Organizations must address the issue of technology – what and how it would be used to allow for effective collaboration, coordination, and  productivity. They would need to consider the physical resources of their organization - would offices be temporary and small, and widely scattered to enable employees to  reach them or would they be large and centralized? What would travel expectations and  support entail? And what structures and approaches could be used to maintain culture  and values? Klosler had asked at the start of the meeting, “How could RSM overcome  the challenge of lost training and development opportunities as well as the  brainstorming of new ideas and building a close culture that happens naturally when  you are sitting side by side with your colleagues?” \\nThere were many tools that were already available but had become invaluable in a  remote work setting10. For example, online whiteboards that mimicked the ability to  create and move around post-it notes on a physical whiteboard, platforms that mimicked  a physical office that allowed employees to create cartoon images of themselves and  physically walk to each other, or even virtual reality office experiences. New methods  such as “Working Out Loud” surfaced as well. The options and tools were endless, and  the most successful companies would harness them not just effectively, but innovatively  to differentiate themselves as employers. \\nCONCLUSION \\nBeing forced to work from home due to COVID created many challenges, but it also  revealed opportunities. It highlighted what could be accomplished remotely such as \\naccessing talent from distant locations. It unearthed flexibility and autonomy for  employees and eliminated long daily commutes. The question that Rhonda Klosler now  wants to focus her leadership team on is how should RSM harness technology to create  a better work experience and environment for Generation Z new hires and co-op  students? What was the right combination of remote and in-person in terms of time and  activities? What specific technologies might be adopted and how might they be used?  She hoped that the team would have some innovative and effective recommendations  for technologies and work design. \\nThe objective of the solution was to make generation Z employees in particular feel  valued and happy working for the company. RSM’s aspiration was to ultimately be the  most desirable employer for top talent across the country.  \\nThe best solution would differentiate RSM from other industry employers, balance  autonomy and flexibility with interaction and bonding and align with and build the RSM  culture. \\nReferences \\n1.

In 2018, the predecessor firm joined RSM International, a global  network of independent audit, tax and consulting firms, and became RSM Canada LLP.  \\nBy 2021, RSM International had more than 12,000 employees in North America and  over 43,000 world-wide. It operates in 120 countries and is considered a leader in  advising middle market leaders2 globally.  \\nRSM Canada currently has offices in Red Deer, Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto. In  2020, the firm achieved $100 million in revenue with 727 employees3. Unlike its  competitors, RSM’s intention is to have integrated offices in the major markets in  Canada – Toronto, Calgary/Edmonton, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver - with a  national alliance of independent firms that help serve the rest of Canada. Located in \\nAlberta and Toronto, the firm is focusing on building its presence in Vancouver, the next  major English-speaking market in Canada.  \\nRSM culture and employee focus \\nThe company’s brand promise is to deliver “The Power of Being Understood.” This  guides how the company wants clients and employees to feel and be treated. RSM had  identified key behaviours (“5 Cs) that were central to delivering the Power of Being  Understood and these were now a large and deeply rooted part of the company culture  (see Exhibit 2 for a visual depiction of the 5Cs and a link to an explainer video). Caring (deep focus on customer) \\nCollaborative (work with and support each other and the client)  Curious (innovative) \\nCritical thinking (truly understanding the client needs)  \\nCourageous (think beyond boundaries; challenge) \\nThe 5Cs applies to all stakeholders throughout their relationship with RSM, including  recruiting new employees because these were the desired characteristics of RSM  advisors. As Klosler pointed out,  \\n“We’re a people business - we are only as good as the people that work  with our clients. Our priority is [therefore] always our people first. But  delivering on the “Power of Being Understood” and applying the 5Cs  approach extends to our clients and is our differentiator – asking  \\nquestions, bringing in other experts/perspectives as needed.” \\nWork environment and culture \\nThe values that they embrace as an organization are respect, integrity, teamwork,  excellence and stewardship4. \\nRSM acts on its core value of stewardship by committing to operate in an  environmentally responsible way but also by giving back to the community. Its various  corporate social responsibility activities are outlined here. The organization has  supported various charitable causes and events throughout the year and encouraged its  employees to do the same. For example, in 2020 RSM Canada had raised $220,000  through its annual stewardship campaign - Birdies for Love. These funds help support  various organizations whose mandate is to enhance education or quality of life for  children and families (see https://rsmcanada.com/newsroom/news-releases/2020/rsm-\\ncanada-donates-more-than-220000-through-2020-birdies-fore-lo.html for further  information).  \\nRSM describes its work environment as one where everyone feels comfortable being  who they are, in other words, to be their authentic selves (see Exhibit 3 - RSM  Recruiting brochure for details on how this is communicated to new recruits). The focus  is on authenticity combined with the “Power of Being Understood,” and to address the  unique needs and aspirations of each employee (see the information provided at this  link for additional details https://rsmus.com/who-we-are/our-values/rsm-talent experience.html). The pillars of the firm’s human resource practices were: flexibility,  career development, inclusiveness and understanding.  \\nRSM’s approach to human resource management focuses on an ideology that each  employee needs to “own your own future”. When new employees join the organization,  they are connected with career advisors and partners to identify areas of interest,  ambitions and how to achieve their career objectives. They are asked to share what  path they want to take so that they could be supported in building the expertise for that  path. Within their first year, they are asked to identify two industries they are interested  in and want to focus on so they could become subject matter experts. They can attend  local, national and US-based conferences that are focused on the employee’s identified  interests. Pre-COVID, everyone would go to Chicago for training with the purpose of not  only learning more about their industry of choice but also to build networks and a  community across North America. There is a strong focus on getting designations as  well and the firms provides paid time off to study and write exams, pay for education, and work with an external vendor to prepare for exams, resulting in a 98% pass rate.  \\nPromoting inclusion and diversity begins with the leadership team and is driven by  Employee Networking Groups (ENGs) that centre on different themes. The ENGs are  driven by employees and their purpose is to create community and a forum for  understanding by bringing employees that have similar interests or backgrounds  together. ENGs are encouraged to create events in which all employees can participate.  The events promote networking, professional development, mentorship, and education  that fosters understanding and respect for members. For example, to foster learning  and growth, ENGs might facilitate “courageous conversations” around their themes,  during which employees can ask any questions that they were struggling with, without  being judged. Courageous conversations focuses on timely topics, including mental  health and systemic racism, and have included external speakers as well as internal  speakers from across North America to aid understanding. Approximately 60% of staff  and partners have chosen to become part of an ENG.\\nLeaders are always present and involved in ENG events. The enthusiasm, engagement  and participation rates of top leaders in organized social activities are comparable to  those of newer employees.  \\nThere are also no barriers between the various levels of the organization, so an  employee anywhere within RSM can reach out to anyone else in the organization for  help, advice and information, regardless of the individual’s position. The camaraderie  and casualness of interactions between employees is not hindered by differences in  where they are on the organizational hierarchy.  \\nRSM’s approach to its employees has been recognized with various awards. In 2021 it  was named one of “Greater Toronto’s Top Employers”1 and in 2020 was recognized  among Canada’s “Most Admired Cultures5”  \\nThe job \\nRSM’s growth is fueled by its partners who build relationships while leveraging teams to  execute on the deliverables with clients.  \\nManagers and their teams work with clients. Consequently, employees collaborate and  coordinate with each other, even as they complete their individual responsibilities. In  addition, sub-groups within lines of business are set up so that they can become subject  matter experts and connect with fellow colleagues in the same area who work on the  same tasks. \\nRather than have employees focus on specific tasks for a variety of projects, they are  given line of sight from cradle to grave on projects so they understand the entire  deliverable and their role in it. Letting employees be involved in all client activities  ensures employees see the value and impact of their work.  \\nTo acknowledge and reward performance, employees are provided fast feedback and  internal points and recognition, “accolades6”, can be awarded to anyone by anyone.  \\nCOVID hits \\nPrior to COVID, it was easy for staff and partners to organically connect and experience  the culture of the organization. It was easier to share stories and ask questions as  people worked side-by-side, passed each other in hallways, or while taking coffee \\nbreaks. You could read quotes on the office walls and participate in various in-person  events throughout the day. \\nQuite suddenly in March 2020, COVID was confirmed a global pandemic. Governmental  responses across the world varied widely, but in Canada the Prime Minister announced  the first in a series of stay-at-home orders, forcing businesses to move employees to  work from home wherever possible. RSM’s top priority was to keep its employees safe  while figuring out how to service clients right in the middle of the busiest time of year.  Canadian leadership had to jump into action and within 24 hours had 727 employees  and partners set up to work remotely. Employees were “tooled up and trained up” on  Webex and other online platforms to support clients and their needs. This was not an  easy task and required trust, solid leadership and lots of online training on how to use  WebEx more efficiently, access the tools online and connect to teams and clients in a  new space.  \\nRhonda Klosler shared that leadership, “over-communicated so our people understood  where we were going and what decisions were being made at all times”. \\nRSM’s IT and HR team quickly identified how to virtually onboard new hires and set  them up with the equipment they needed (ex. laptops) so that were ready to go from  their first day on the job. All new hires went through extensive virtual training with  collaboration with colleagues across Canada and the U.S.  \\nExternally, RSM had to pivot to address clients’ needs and opportunities in a new way.  Audit and tax functions had to be moved completely online and the consulting line of  business, which was now outpacing the other two lines of business on growth, had to  focus on technology, digital capabilities, and infrastructure for technology because  clients now needed this support to build new skill sets.  \\nInitially, technology was the biggest challenge. Employees were given as much support  as needed but they were also asked to give themselves grace. They were used to being  the best in what they do and struggled to give themselves time to adjust in this new  environment. They were encouraged to reach out for help and told that it was okay if  everything wasn’t perfect. There were regular touchpoint meetings to check-in with  employees/teams and make sure they had what they needed for their jobs and  themselves. \\nOnce the organization found its rhythm with remote working, it pivoted to creating  community. There were quarterly calls to bring different ENG communities together. \\nSocial activities such as virtual escape rooms and an online Second City comedy night  were organized.  \\nRSM was also cognizant of Zoom/WebEx fatigue so they started putting boundaries on  expectations, i.e. don’t answer emails after a certain time in the evening, block a lunch  break to step away from work and your computer, take meetings as calls rather than  videos, and try “walking meetings” outside. They began using breakout rooms and  surveys to capture thoughts and opinions to ensure all voices were being heard and  many are hesitant to speak up in large, remote groups. The firm moved their summer  leadership program online and held it virtually across Canada. In 2020, the focus was  on what technology could be used so the experience didn’t look clunky - they used more  cameras, integrated surveys and used breakout rooms to create a more comfortable  experience.  \\nRecruiting new talent was done completely online and there was an important silver  lining: RSM was able to attract excellent talent from remote markets because  employees were not constrained by the need to travel or live near RSM’s physical  offices.  \\nIn January 2021, it was clear that RSM had been able to successfully pivot to remote  work. It was having its best year ever, growing revenue 12 to 13% year-over-year – with  tax and consulting services leading the growth particularly in areas like digital  transformation and automation. \\nGENERATION Z CHARACTERISTICS7,8 \\nGeneration Z is referred to as individuals born between 1997 and 2012. Professional  and academic achievement is generally highly valued by this generation, and they are  focused on personal growth and development. At the same time, this generation values  purpose and social responsibility. They are digital natives and have never known a time  when the internet did not exist, but they also crave in-person interaction. They want  human connections and to feel like they are part of a team. Studies suggest that when  dealing with a remote Generation Z worker, recurring meetings are good for bonding  and ensuring this person is heard. Connectivity via video calls are better than telephone  calls.  \\nWhat sets this group apart is that COVID disrupted their education and disconnected  them from their regular learning in a communal setting. The way this groups learns has  therefore been impacted which means that employers may have to reconsider their \\norientation and skill development programs in future years. In addition, the substantial  disruption to their social and educational experiences has increased their baseline  stress levels far above those of prior generations. \\nRemote versus in-person tradeoffs and issues \\nThere was a range of options between entirely remote and entirely in-office work design  (see Exhibit 4 - The In-office to Fully remote continuum). After organizations recovered  from the imposed requirement to work remotely, they began to reconsider the potential  for doing so more systematically and permanently. Large companies such as Facebook  and Twitter announced they would take a large-scale approach and that working  remotely would be permanently adopted.9 \\nHowever, it was clear that the issue was not simply a matter of offering employees  laptops and enabling video calls. Organizations must address the issue of technology – what and how it would be used to allow for effective collaboration, coordination, and  productivity. They would need to consider the physical resources of their organization - would offices be temporary and small, and widely scattered to enable employees to  reach them or would they be large and centralized? What would travel expectations and  support entail? And what structures and approaches could be used to maintain culture  and values? Klosler had asked at the start of the meeting, “How could RSM overcome  the challenge of lost training and development opportunities as well as the  brainstorming of new ideas and building a close culture that happens naturally when  you are sitting side by side with your colleagues?” \\nThere were many tools that were already available but had become invaluable in a  remote work setting10. For example, online whiteboards that mimicked the ability to  create and move around post-it notes on a physical whiteboard, platforms that mimicked  a physical office that allowed employees to create cartoon images of themselves and  physically walk to each other, or even virtual reality office experiences. New methods  such as “Working Out Loud” surfaced as well. The options and tools were endless, and  the most successful companies would harness them not just effectively, but innovatively  to differentiate themselves as employers. \\nCONCLUSION \\nBeing forced to work from home due to COVID created many challenges, but it also  revealed opportunities. It highlighted what could be accomplished remotely such as \\naccessing talent from distant locations. It unearthed flexibility and autonomy for  employees and eliminated long daily commutes. The question that Rhonda Klosler now  wants to focus her leadership team on is how should RSM harness technology to create  a better work experience and environment for Generation Z new hires and co-op  students? What was the right combination of remote and in-person in terms of time and  activities? What specific technologies might be adopted and how might they be used?  She hoped that the team would have some innovative and effective recommendations  for technologies and work design. \\nThe objective of the solution was to make generation Z employees in particular feel  valued and happy working for the company. RSM’s aspiration was to ultimately be the  most desirable employer for top talent across the country.  \\nThe best solution would differentiate RSM from other industry employers, balance  autonomy and flexibility with interaction and bonding and align with and build the RSM  culture. \\nReferences \\n1.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'My thoughts on sloth', 'date': '2021-08-27T16:26:39.065Z'}, page_content=\"My thoughts on sloth\\n\\nRight now, I’m thinking of “sloth” as a blanket definition of laziness, which is something I’ve been dealing with recently. If I was to describe it, I would say it’s a feeling of lethargy, demotivation, and almost constant boredom. I wonder how many people deal with the same combinations of emotions.\\n\\nTo preface, I don’t think I’m a person with an innately lazy nature. While I do regularly take shortcuts while I’m working, I don’t feel like I avoid work at all costs. For example, I’ve been relatively-diligently completing my MATHL99 online math course, making sure I understand the content so I can have a solid foundation for entering university. In this sense, I pride myself in achieving a certain degree of performance quality whenever I work. \\n\\nSadly, this doesn’t apply to what I’ve been doing lately, which is programming. I’ve recently been attempting to copy a person’s tensorflow project that uses object detection to fix people’s habits. I’ve become so lazy that it took me approximately 3 days just to download all the tensorflow packages, and copy/paste a snippet of code that I found online. \\n\\nTo go into detail, my mind falls easily into a state of boredom while I do this work. Throughout my task, I carry an ultimate goal of understanding what I’m coding. However, I often find myself falling into mental trances, where I just sit there, staring at the screen for noticeable amounts of time. My mind wanders off, sometimes to trace the melody of the music I’m listen to, and other times just to slouch. After approximately 1 hour of this behaviour, I become overwhelmed and take a multi-hour break. This doesn’t sound very efficient, doesn’t it?\\n\\nIf I were to allocate some blame onto something, it would be that this task doesn’t feel very purposeful. Furthermore, it’s got a degree of complexity to it which makes it hard to digest. For example, how do I figure out the category IDs of the objects that I’ve detected? If the COCO dataset trained model I’m using declares “1” as a human detection, then what number does it assign to a cell phone? \\n\\nAll these questions I have are easy to answer, but for some reason I refuse to take the few steps required to resolve them. For example, for the larger “build a project issue”, I can simply copy the owner’s code, and attempt to understand it from there. For the ID confusion, I can simply go about using trial and error. Eg. flashing a cellphone in front of my webcam and making the code output its accompanying ID. But for some reason, I just refuse to take that action. \\n\\nI think part of my reluctance is due to my belief in optimal efficacy. If there’s an easier way to do something, then I’ll very unlikely settle for something less. In this case, if there’s a more effective way to learn what I’m wanting to learn, then I will likely refuse all other options. \\n\\nBut here’s the issue. While I believe that there exists a more efficient model of learning, will what I believe always appear in reality? Is it always possible to find what I’m looking for? What if, in the time it takes me to find and comprehend the most effective solution, I would’ve already understood the easier method? What if, all the searching leads nowhere, and I’m left behind in comparison to the me that took the “suboptimal” route?\\n\\nMaybe it’s all with the goal of saving time, but I don’t really know. When have I ever treasured time, aside from the night before a heavy assessment? \\n\\nWith no other explanations, I can only declare that I am an avid practitioner of sloth. No matter what I’m doing, I refuse the more laborious work in favour of the hypothetical optimal work. Unless I've accepted that the optimal work doesn’t exist, I will continue to reluctantly continue the laborious work with weak levels of motivation. It’s a bit disheartening to see how much I struggle whenever I’m challenged with facing new adversities. Perhaps it could improve, the more I face these challenges? \\n\\nOne last thought. I read yesterday that regular porn watchers had decreased brain volumes in the region associated with rewards and motivation. To me, it’s an inconvenient but also a sensible point. After all, given that all beings’ existences are to reproduce, one conclusion is that all humans are subconsciously sexually motivated (not lust, but reproduction oriented). Their strive for reproduction is what motivates them to continue their daily tasks, which allows them to become more proficient at what they do, regardless in relation to actual reproduction. When this strive for reproduction is met with a condition of success ie through masturbation, this results in a lesser sense of urgency/motivation in completing one’s daily tasks. Thus providing the reasoning for why porn consumers may find themselves more lethargic and demotivated. \\n\\nAs an extension, I think I can speculate more towards the reasoning behind the negative relationship between sexual gratification and motivation. Could it be that humans become worse at producing offspring with each successive act, resulting in a natural sense of demotivation? I don’t know about males, but females stop reproducing beyond the age of 50, and up to then, their children have an increased rate of having a birth defect the closer they are to that age. Maybe, this successive act counter is reflective of the number of 50, and establishes a baseline, for, something. Or maybe it’s a natural measure against overpopulation, who knows.\\n\\nIn any case, being so lazy will get in the way of a successful university experience. I hope I learn to effectively abstain, and to uphold higher levels of motivation to help me triumph over daunting tasks.\\n\\nAug 27 ~1:00PM\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'My thoughts on studying', 'date': '2021-08-16T00:31:18.930Z'}, page_content='Song- mary playlist\\n\\nWhile I was driving today, I asked myself the question: what is the point of studying so hard? Is there a reason to surrender human relationships for the sake of your future? If I’m prepared to enter my program, then I should also be prepared to double down on trimming away my social time, as bad for my mental health as it may be. \\n\\nBut for what and why am I doing this? If I, a currently socially struggling individual, instead allocated myself to preserving the friendships I already have, would I find myself surrounded in a better environment where I could be happier? I believe that these are the two options: to invest in future happiness by studying now, or by risking future happiness in exchange for current happiness. \\n\\nI think I should rephrase my concerns. I don’t believe that pursuing happiness should be one’s goal in life, and what one sacrifices themselves for. I thought about this a few days ago, and I think the meaning of life is to have purpose. It’s funny to say this, because “meaning” and “purpose” are two words already closely related in definition. \\n\\nWhen phrased as “purpose” instead of “happiness”, how does that affect the original question of this entry: “what am I supposed to be doing right now?”. In my eyes, this rephrasing heavily favours studying. A person who commits themselves to current relationships invests themselves in activities with less purpose. Granted, relationships remain important, due to its beneficial impact on life stressors and pitfalls. Eg. turning to a friend as a coping mechanism while pursuing your purpose. \\n\\nIf everything in the last paragraph is correct, then my current priority should be focused on school, with attention to relationships being a secondary goal. As for activities such as sports, gaming, and recreation, I think that they are equally as important as relationships, yet not as important as studying. Tier 1 would be studying, Tier 2 would be everything else listed above, as well as what I’m doing right now. \\n\\nI almost feel as if I’m using this to comfort myself that deciding to live alone instead of with my mom, sister, and cousin is the correct option. \\n\\nIn any case, I’ve concluded that my current goal in life is to study. Without a need to study, my goals can then refocus onto the Tier 2 activities. By studying, I attain purpose in my daily life. While the specifics of what this “purpose” entails is vague, I think it’s something I’ve realized myself after coming to understand my nature and personal habits, even if I can’t voice it with clarity.\\n\\nThough, if I were to guess, I hope my purpose isn’t as shallow as to “become rich to secure a future”. Deep down, I wish to still think that I’m a child that still has their altruistic innocence. After all, doesn’t helping humanity seem like a good purpose for a human? \\n\\nAs I type, I feel as if my thoughts are becoming less organized. But at the same time, I’m feeling more at peace, as if I’ve come to some realization despite the mental mess. \\n\\nAug 15, 8:52 PM'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Google Documents', 'title': 'My thoughts on being alone', 'date': '2021-08-15T03:35:47.296Z'}, page_content='Song- Daybreak Frontline, cover by mary\\n\\nThey say that there’s a difference between feeling “solitude” and feeling ”alone”, the difference being the individual’s emotional state of mind. In one, the individual is content and at peace, while in the other, the individual is surrounded not by people but by insecurities. I think I have felt both emotions before, and more than just for once. \\n\\nI don’t quite understand myself, and at times I see myself as a convoluting, contradictory person. However, one thing I’ve noticed is the state of peace I feel when I am by myself. Even for bonds as tight as friends and family, I always arrive at a state of imminent exhaustion after I interact with them for prolonged durations of time. For example, I’m always excited to see my cousins, and whenever they leave Waterloo I equally experience feelings of sadness. Despite this, I equally treasure the alone time I have afterwards. If they were to interrupt this sequential time to myself, I wouldn’t see them as highly as during the time before and during their planned stay. \\n\\nMaybe it’s the concept of a social battery that applies the best. If someone were to say that my social battery held less capacity than the average person’s, I would wholeheartedly agree. In order to have the best experiences with someone, I wish for every moment with them to be at the pinnacle that they can be at. Once an interaction drags on, it’s disappointing aftertaste is what overrides the efforts placed beforehand. I want to continue having great times with other people, so I try making my efforts shorter yet more meaningful. \\n\\nOn the other hand, being by myself is one of my greatest comforts in life. I feel like it’s where I can be me, and not interrupt others from being themselves. I enjoy playing my Yorushika songs aloud and living in a mentally organized pigsty. I enjoy immersing myself into my tasks, and being able to complete them without interruptions from other people. I enjoy performing actions that are core to my nature, while knowing it isn’t interfering with anyone else. If these were to be disrupted, I don’t know what I would do. \\n\\nIt may sound silly, and with minimal reflection, I’ve concluded that I’m a lazy person. I’d like to be myself, and I’ve figured that the best way to do it isn’t to change my environment, but to adapt to whatever’s around it. While both may sound proactive, my method of adaptation is to simply avoid contact with others in efforts to reduce the trouble I find myself in. Nonetheless, I really enjoy my alone time, and I hope it’s something my future self can compromise with.\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nAugust 14th, 2021\\n\\n11:55PM\\n\\nMaybe it’s because I’m ashamed of the music I listen to, or some other aspect of myself that I would rather hide it along with myself away from others. It’s contradictory because more public exposure should help with self-acceptance.'),\n",

What tools did you use and what was the outcome?*\\n\\nA project that I am proud of is my Python balloon deflation tracker. As part of my Grade 12 math curriculum, I was given an assignment where I was to conduct a math-related investigation. While I had trouble coming up with my topic idea, I knew I wanted to put my programming experience to use, given all the extra time I’d have over the quarantined-winter break.\\n\\nOnce I settled on the topic of balloon deflation modelling, I approached it with the help of the class-taught calculus, as well as some additional integration that I later explored online. Using Python’s OpenCV module, I created a video analysis program where I would locate the contour of the balloon in every video frame. Assuming a balloon’s symmetrical nature, half of the balloon’s contour would then be generalized into a Numpy generated equation. This contour would finally provide an accurate estimate of the balloon’s volume, which was determined through integration of the contour equation.\\n\\nI was very satisfied with the outcome of the project. Despite some shortcomings in my program, I liked seeing my logic come to fruition and my program fulfill its task. Above all, I also enjoyed the idea of exploration and its accompanying feelings of uncertainty. I was happy to follow my premade plans and others’ Python tutorials to arrive at my final product. \\n\\nWhich panels or workshops are you most interested in seeing at Hack the 6ix?\\n\\nBeing my first hackathon, I don’t have a firm grasp on what sorts of workshops I’d find at Hack the 6ix. However, I’m currently most interested in developing my programming portfolio. After following my interests and entering a computer science program in university, I’m now worried about my next immediate obstacle, being potential future interviews. While I’ve been focusing on programming contest problems up until now, I would now like to transfer those skills into real life projects and applications. Because of this, I’d be most interested in seeing workshops related to GitHub usage, project development, and even web development. I’m not sure of what other workshops to expect, but I’m certain that they could all provide a lot to the current me. \\n\\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by attending Hack the 6ix?\\nBy attending Hack the 6ix, I hope to ultimately develop my programming skills. I hope to add to my portfolio by entering more hackathons, and be able to learn from others’ programming experiences from the people I encounter. I hope that participating in Hack the 6ix, as well as further hackathons, will help improve the quality and methodology of my future personal projects.
